# Thyseus v0.12 Release

Hey - thanks for checking out the blog, home of the most up-to-date info on
what's happening with Thyseus! I hope you're enjoying the new design - this
fresh coat of paint also comes with partial rewrites to much of the
documentation, and a bunch of new stuff, too!

If you're new here, Thyseus is a multi-threadable, DX-focused, and highly
performant archetypal Entity Component System (ECS) written entirely in
Typescript; check out the docs to learn more and get started.

With that, we've got to cover Thyseus' biggest (and most exciting) update yet,
so let's get into it!

## The transformer

Thyseus v0.12 is releasing with a sibling package - the Thyseus transformer! The
transformer has a ton of potential, but for now its singularly focused. The
transformer isn't required, but it will be considered the "canonical" way to
develop with Thyseus.

<Aside type="note">
	**The transformer is currently only available as a
	[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) plugin.** Please don't hesitate to [open a
	request](https://github.com/JaimeGensler/thyseus-transformer/issues) for a
	similar plugin for your bundler of choice.
</Aside>

Install:

```sh
pnpm add -D @thyseus/transformer-vite
```

And configure:

```ts filename="vite.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import { thyseusTransformer } from '@thyseus/transformer-vite';

export default defineConfig({
	plugins: [thyseusTransformer()],
	// your other config...
});
```

And you're good to go! The transformer's version will always match Thyseus'
current version, so always update both.

## Systems

**Systems are now just functions** - thanks to the transformer, we removed
`defineSystem()`, and you don't need to fuss with parameter creators anymore.
Type your systems and let the transformer handle the rest!

```ts
// The classic example
function movementSystem(query: Query<[Mut<Position>, Velocity]>) {
	for (const [pos, vel] of query) {
		pos.x += vel.x;
		pos.y += vel.y;
		pos.z += vel.z;
	}
}

// Something a little out there
function aSystemThatUsesEveryParameterTypeForSomeReason(
	world: World,
	commands: Commands,
	query: Query<[Mut<Position>, Velocity], With<IsPlayer>>,
	time: Res<Time>,
	localData: SystemRes<Set<string>>,
	eventReader: EventReader<LevelUpEvent>,
	eventWriter: EventWriter<LevelUpEvent>,
) {
	// I wonder what this would even do?
}

// Later

const world = await World.new()
	.addSystems(movementSystem)
	.addSystems(aSystemThatUsesEveryParameterTypeForSomeReason)
	.build();
```

Yup, that works. âœ¨

It's been a goal from the very beginning to provide this API, so we're pretty
stoked to have finally reached this milestone. Bear in mind that this is the
first version of the transformer, so despite rigorous testing, it's possible
that some bugs have made it in; be sure to report any issues you find.

The transformer allows one-off transformation opt-outs - add a comment with
`thyseus-ignore` before the code you want preserved, and the transformer will
simply skip that node.

If you're wondering about custom system parameters, don't worry -
[we've got you covered](/docs/advanced_patterns/custom_system_parameters#transforming-system-parameters).

### Systems without transformation

The transformer takes care of adding a `parameters` property to your system
functions for you. The `parameters` property is an array of system parameter
descriptors; worlds read these descriptors to determine what arguments to supply
to the system.

If you're not using Typescript, are building a 3rd party plugin, or are
otherwise opting out of system transformation, systems are still easy to write:
just add the `parameters` property and create the descriptors yourself:

```js
// New import specifically for descriptors
import { ResourceDescriptor } from 'thyseus/descriptors';
import { MyResourceType } from './somewhere';

export function mySystem(resource) {}
mySystem.parameters = [ResourceDescriptor(MyResourceType)];
```

### Usage tips

If you're using the transformer, there are a couple things to note.

-   **Only function declarations and function expressions in variable
    initialization are transformed.** Function expressions passed inline to
    other functions won't be transformed, but you can always provide parameters
    manually.

```ts
// This works great!
function systemA(world: World) {}

// This too!
const systemB = function systemBInner(world: World) {};

// And of course we wouldn't forget about arrow functions!
const systemC = (world: World) => {};
```

-   **Type aliases are not permitted;** simple aliases
    (`type MyQuery = Query<...>`), or "namespaced" types (`Thyseus.Commands`)
    will not be transformed. Don't worry - we plan to add support in the future!
-   **Functions with rest parameters will not be transformed,** even if the
    parameters are typed as a tuple containing only valid system parameters.
-   **Import the full class, not just the type.** When using class types, the
    transformer assumes the actual class is in scope, so if you're getting a
    reference error, it's probably because of this.
-   **Systems can't be generic.** Of course, you can still create generic "base"
    functions and call them in systems with your non-generic data.
-   **Functions that accept only system parameters will have a `parameters`
    property added.** You can ignore this or `//thyseus-ignore` it - up to you!

## Types

With the changes to systems, we've made sure to **export _all_ the types**. Even
better, this is a two-for-one deal - you can choose between type imports
directly from `'thyseus'`, or a global type injection. The choice of which of
these you use is up to you; the docs assume global type imports for the sake of
brevity, but go with whatever feels right.

### Direct type imports

Don't want a library injecting its types into the global scope? We get it - by
default, Thyseus **does not** add types to the global scope. Import directly
from 'thyseus' for all your type needs:

```ts
import type { Commands, SystemRes } from 'thyseus';

function mySystem(
	commands: Commands,
	localData: SystemRes<Map<object, object>>,
) {}
```

### Global type injection

Tired of writing imports? Me too - this is the way for you! Add the
`'thyseus/types'` import anywhere (I recommend a `src/thyseusGlobals.d.ts`
file), and all Thyseus types will be available, anywhere in your project:

```ts filename="src/thyseusGlobals.d.ts"
import 'thyseus/types';
```

## System scheduling

System scheduling has needed rethinking for a while. It's become clear that a
single `update()` method on worlds is lackluster DX. Worse, it fails to make it
clear, easy, or in some cases _possible_ to incorporate patterns like fixed time
steps or custom execution logic. As is the trend with Thyseus' development, we
took inspiration from [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) and their stagless update.

### Schedules

A schedule is a collection of systems. Every schedule has a dedicated executor,
which means **each schedule can use a different executor**. When a schedule is
run, _all_ systems in that schedule must complete their execution before another
schedule can be run. However, schedules may contain systems that run other
schedules _inside_ them.

Schedules are a conceptually cleaner way of handling different "groups" of
systems. In past versions of Thyseus, startup systems were handled seperately
from "normal" systems - but no more! Startup systems are now just systems that
belong to a schedule that only runs once.

A schedule is labeled by a `Symbol()` - there's nothing special about the
built-in symbols, so you can freely use all/some/none of the built-in schedules
and supplement them with your own!

### Adding systems

We've removed `WorldBuilder.addSystem()` and `WorldBuilder.addStartupSystem()`
in favor of more versatile and more descriptive methods:
`WorldBuiler.addSystems()` (notice the **s**) and
`WorldBuilder.addSystemsToSchedule()`.

As the name implies, `addSystems()` can add multiple systems at once. This
change pairs especially nicely with some of the new additions to the dependency
API. `addSystems()` adds systems to the "main" schedule (`CoreSchedule.Main`).

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```ts
import { World } from 'thyseus';
import { systemA, systemB, systemC } from './systems';

export const myWorld = await World.new()
	.addSystems(
		systemA, 
		systemB, 
		systemC
	)
	.build();
```

If you want to add systems into a different schedule, use
`addSystemsToSchedule()`. Simply pass the unique symbol for a schedule as the
first argument and your systems as the remaining arguments.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```ts
import { World, CoreSchedule } from 'thyseus';
import { spawnEntities, physicsA, physicsB, physicsC } from './systems';

export const myWorld = await World.new()
	.addSystemsToSchedule(
		CoreSchedule.Startup,
		spawnEntities
	)
	.addSystemsToSchedule(
		CoreSchedule.FixedUpdate, 
		physicsA, 
		physicsB, 
		physicsC,
	)
	.build();
```

### Running schedules

`world.update()` has been removed and replaced with two new methods!

`world.runSchedule(schedule: symbol)` runs a single schedule; it returns a
promise that only resolves when every system in that schedule has completed
executing. You must await this promise before calling `world.runSchedule()`
again in the same system.

`world.start()` is responsible for starting up your app. It runs startup systems
and establishes a typical game loop with `requestAnimationFrame()`. You can
customize the behavior of `start()` by adding systems to `CoreSchedule.Outer`.

For now, there are four schedules provided out of the box:

-   `CoreSchedule.Startup` is the schedule for startup systems. By default, this
    schedule will run exactly once when `world.start()`.
-   `CoreSchedule.Main` is the main schedule for systems - this is the schedule
    that systems are added to when you call `world.addSystems()`. By default,
    this schedule will run once per frame.
-   `CoreSchedule.FixedUpdate` is intended for systems that must run at a
    consistent rate, like physics systems. By default, this schedule is run 0 or
    more times per frame, depending on the time passed since its last run. By
    default, it targets 50 updates/second (20ms timestep), and executes _after_
    `CoreSchedule.Main`.
-   `CoreSchedule.Outer` controls the execution of all other schedules. By
    default, it contains one system (`runInnerSchedules`) that runs the startup
    schedule, and creates a loop for the main and fixed update schedules. If you
    add systems to this schedule, `runInnerSchedules()` will **disable itself**
    so you can add in your own custom game loop logic.

## System dependencies

We're overhauling the system dependency API again. The old API had potentially
confusing gotchas, like potentially different results depending on where you
called `systemA.before(systemB)` and ignoring ordering constraints if it thought
the order was unobservable. The new API allows clearer, more predictable
dependencies and **always respects them**.

### `run()`

Dependencies can be specified with the new `run()` function. It returns a
`SystemConfig` object, which can be used to specify dependencies (and in the
future, even more).

```ts
import { World, run } from 'thyseus';
import { systemA, systemB, systemC } from './systems';

export const myWorld = await World.new()
	.addSystems(
		run(systemA).before(systemB),
		systemB,
		run(systemC).after(systemB),
	)
	.build();
```

Note that you're only actually adding the single system that `run()` wraps.
Methods are included for `before()`, `after()`, `first()` and `last()`. The new
API also has one more trick up its sleeve to make the above pattern a little
simpler:

```ts
import { World, run } from 'thyseus';
import { systemA, systemB, systemC } from './systems';

export const myWorld = await World.new()
	.addSystems(...run.chain(systemA, systemB, systemC))
	.build();
```

`run.chain()` creates an ordering where the systems must run in the order passed
to the `chain` function - in the above case, `systemA`, then `systemB`, then
`systemC`.

## Other changes

### World config changes

The `memory` option has been renamed to `memorySize` to be more descriptive of
what the option controls.

You can use the `useSharedMemory: boolean` option to force the use of
`SharedArrayBuffer` for single-threaded worlds. When set to true,
`isSecureContext` must be true, but you don't need to pass a worker url. When
using multithreading, this option is ignored. The default is `false`.

You can now specify whether the current thread is the main thread with
`isMainThread: boolean`, which should significantly improve the useability of
Thyseus in non-browser environments. The default for this option is a
browser-oriented main-thread check: `typeof window !== 'undefined'`.

### Table changes

Tables are no longer constructed on worker threads. This probably doesn't mean
much to you, unless you previously tried to access tables on threads. Table
_data_ is still accessible from any thread, and queries have been refactored to
not need table instances so that they may still run on all threads.

`table.size` has been renamed to `table.length`. Moving forward we're
standardizing around using "length" to denote the number of items in a structure
and "size" to denote the size (in bytes) of a structure.

### Removal of `definePlugin()`

The inclusion of this function in the first place was a little silly, to be
honest - its sole purpose was to provide type help for writing plugins, but
plugins are already really, _really_ easy to type correctly.

```ts
import type { WorldBuilder } from 'thyseus';

// This is all there is to it!
function yourPlugin(builder: WorldBuilder) {
	// ...
}
```

### Removal of `createThreadChannel()`

Internally, we've removed the need for creating thread message channels. While
it's possible this need will return, the current API isn't really up to our
standards and so has been removed for the time being.

Currently, if you still happen to need a way of creating thread message
channels, it is still possible to add the handlers directly after building a
world.

### Entity component

The `Entity` component now has a `hasComponent(componentType: Struct)` method to
check if an entity has a component - no need to modify your queries anymore!

The `Entity` component will also throw an error if you try to construct it
without passing `world.commands` and `world.entities`. This is most likely to
occur if you're trying to use it as a sub-component, which unfortunately is not
supported at the moment.

### Memory API

The `memory` API has been exposed. A docs page has been added on how to use it -
the TL;DR is **don't**.

## What's next?

In the next updates, we're likely to start honing in on performance. Thyseus has
been architected with performance in mind from the beginning, but we've been so
focused on feature work that we haven't been able to push that architecture to
its full potential. Expect improvements in the form of internal tweaks, new
fast-path APIs, and auto-magic transformations!

While a 1.0 release is still a little ways off, we're more optimistic than ever
about the future of Thyseus. The goal for the next few updates is to make them
smaller and push them out more frequent updates - for the time being, we hope
you enjoy v0.12!
