# Resources

Resources are world-unique data that exist for the entire lifetime of the world.
Unlike components, they are not tied to a specific entity. Resources can
elegantly handle things like time (frame number, delta, etc.), renderers,
inputs, and other data that is unique to a world rather than an entity.

## Defining resources

Resources are classes:

```ts
class Time {
	static fromWorld() {
		return new this();
	}
	previous: number = 0;
	current: number = 0;
	delta: number = 0;
	frameNumber: number = 0;
}

class Renderer {
	draw() {
		// ...
	}
}
```

Thyseus must When these resources are used by systems, they will be refering to
the same object.

```ts
class MyResource {}

function systemA(myResource: Res<MyResource>) {
	// myResource here...
}
function systemB(myResource: Res<MyResource>) {
	// ... is the same object as myResource here!
}
```

Like components, resources can be wrapped in `Readonly` or `Read` if you'd like
to narrow the type.

```ts
class MyResource {}

function someSystem(myResource: Res<Readonly<MyResource>>) {}
```

Resources must either implement a static `fromWorld() {}` method, or be directly
inserted into the world with `World.p.insertResource()`.

<Callout type="tip">
	If you have a type that you'd like to use as multiple resources, you can
	simply subclass it.
</Callout>

## Initializing Resources

If you'd like your resources to be automatically created by the world, you can
implement the static `fromWorld() {}` method that will be called when schedules
are prepared. This method will be passed the `world` building the resource, and
so can insert _additional_ resources or event listeners. This method can also
simply return an instance of the class.

`fromWorld()` must return either an instance of the resource you'd like to
create, **or a promise** that resolves to that instance.

```ts
import { World } from 'thyseus';

class Keyboard {
	static fromWorld(world: World) {
		return new this(world);
	}

	constructor(world: World) {
		function handleKeypress() {
			// ... implementation
		}
		world
			.addEventListener('start', () => {
				document.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeypress);
			})
			.addEventListener('stop', () => {
				document.removeEventListener('keydown', handleKeypress);
			});
	}
}
```

## System Resources

System Resources are a variation of resources that are unique _per system_,
rather than per world. This means that multiple system resources of the same
type can exist in the world. A system can also have multiple of the same type of
system resource, each containing different values:

```ts
class A {
	value: number = 0;
}

function mySystem(a1: Res<A>, a2: Res<A>) {
	console.log(a1 === a2); // -> true
}
function mySystem(a1: SystemRes<A>, a2: SystemRes<A>) {
	console.log(a1 === a2); // -> false
}
```

Apart from their scope, system resources function identically to normal
resources; the same class could be used both as a system resource and as a world
resource.
