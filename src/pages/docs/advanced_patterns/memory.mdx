# Memory API

<Callout type="error">
	Working directly with the `Memory` API comes with significant risks.
	Incorrect usage of the API can lead to corruption of any or all
	Thyseus-specific data in an application. Proceed with extreme caution.
</Callout>

Thyseus uses a custom memory allocator to have fine-grain control over memory
layout in applications. It allocates an ArrayBuffer when a world is built and
partitions it as needed with functions like `Memory.alloc()`, `Memory.free()`,
and more. Reading and writing data in this memory is handled with pointers -
unsigned integer offsets, which can be used to index into views over the buffer.

This page will give you an overview on how to use the allocator, but will not
cover detailed usage such as thread safety. Note that any behavior you observe
with the allocator that is not documented here (e.g., a minimum pointer value) -
_no matter how consistent it appears to be_ - is **not** guaranteed behavior and
could change in a patch or minor release, without documentation.

<Callout type="warn">
	It is very easy to write broken code with this API, and there are very few
	built-in guardrails against incorrect use - write tests!
</Callout>

## Allocating

After memory has been initialized, memory can be allocated with
`Memory.alloc(size: number): Pointer`.

```ts
import { Memory } from 'thyseus';
// Requests 8 bytes for allocations.
// Returns a pointer - an unsigned integer offet into memory.
const myPointer = Memory.alloc(8);
console.log(typeof myPointer); // 'number'
```

Note that pointers are **always** 8-byte aligned, and so can be used to index
into any memory view. Also note that the allocator is thread-safe, so you need
not worry about calling `alloc()` (or `realloc()`, or `free()`) at the same time
on different threads.

The allocator may choose to reserve more space than requested, but will never
reserve less. If there is not enough space for it to complete an allocation, an
error will be thrown.

### Reallocating

For dynamically sized types, you may need to _reallocate_ a previously
allocation with a new size. This can be done with the provided `realloc()` and
`reallocAt()` functions.

```ts
import { Memory } from 'thyseus';

// Getting our initial pointer
const myPointer = Memory.alloc(8);

// Reallocating - our data will be preserved
const newPointer = Memory.realloc(myPointer, 16);
// NOTE: myPointer is no longer valid for use! Only use newPointer now.
```

<Callout type="note">
	As an optimization, `realloc()` will perform a zero-copy in-place grow if
	possible. If it cannot, it will allocate, copy, and free.
</Callout>

After a pointer has been reallocated, its previous value is invalid and must not
be used. Bear in mind that `realloc()` cannot update pointers held locally in
other threads. For example:

```ts {10-13}
class MyDataStructure {
	pointer: number;
	size: number;

	constructor(pointer: number, size: number) {
		this.pointer = pointer;
		this.size = size;
	}

	grow() {
		this.pointer = Memory.realloc(this.pointer, this.size * 2);
		this.size *= 2;
	}
}
```

This _appears_ okay - but imagine that `MyDataStructure` is constructed in
another thread, sharing the same pointer in that thread:

```ts
// Main Thread
myInstance.grow();

// ...some time later, in a different thread
Memory.u8[myInstance.pointer];
```

In the above case, the `pointer` on the class will be updated on the main
thread, but **not** in the worker thread. When we try to access the pointer in a
worker thread, we will be using a pointer that has been freed!

To resolve this, the primary pointer that is shared between both threads
**cannot change**. That pointer must point to _another_ pointer, which _can_ be
resized.

```ts {9-18}
class MySafeDataStructure {
	pointer: number;

	constructor(pointer: number) {
		// Pointer will point to two u32 values: [pointer, size]
		this.pointer = pointer;
	}

	grow() {
		const size = Memory.u32[(this.pointer + 4) >> 2];
		// Realloc pointer at our pointer
		Memory.u32[this.pointer >> 2] = Memory.realloc(
			Memory.u32[this.pointer >> 2],
			size * 2,
		);
		Memory.u32[(this.pointer + 4) >> 2] = size * 2;
	}
}
```

In the vast majority of cases, `realloc()` will be used on pointers held in the
buffer itself like the above example. For this reason, a `reallocAt()` function
is provided. `reallocAt()` accepts a pointer and a new size, and treats the u32
value at that pointer as a pointer itself.

```ts
grow() {
	Memory.reallocAt(this.pointer >> 2, size * 2);
	Memory.u32[(this.pointer + 4) >> 2] = size * 2;
}
```

Now we're safely reallocating!

## Using Pointers

<Callout type="error">
	Memory that you have not claimed for yourself belongs to the allocator. The
	allocator may use memory it owns for internal purposes; writing to values
	the allocator owns will likely result in infinite loops and complete
	corruption of data in the buffer.
</Callout>

Now that you own a section of memory, you may read and write values from it. The
`Memory` object exposes a view of every type over the entire buffer:

```ts
type Memory = {
	// ...
	buffer: ArrayBuffer;
	u8: Uint8Array;
	u16: Uint16Array;
	u32: Uint32Array;
	u64: BigUint64Array;
	i8: Int8Array;
	i16: Int16Array;
	i32: Int32Array;
	i64: BigInt64Array;
	f32: Float32Array;
	f64: Float64Array;
	dataview: DataView;
};
```

The `Memory` object is guaranteed to be referentially stable for its entire
lifetime, **but its members are currently not**.

Because a pointer is a _byte_ offset in memory and typed array access uses
_indexes_, you'll need to do a little pointer manipulation when accessing typed
arrays with value sizes larger than a single byte. Fortunately, this is as
simple as shifting bits:

```ts
import { Memory } from 'thyseus';

const myPointer = Memory.alloc(8);
Memory.u8[myPointer]; // No need to shift for single byte vals!
Memory.u16[myPointer >> 1]; // Shift right once
Memory.u32[myPointer >> 2]; // Shift right twice
Memory.u64[myPointer >> 3]; // Shift right thrice
```

To access an offset of your pointer that you own, you can do pointer arithmetic.

```ts
import { Memory } from 'thyseus';

const pointer = Memory.alloc(8);
const firstU32 = Memory.u32[pointer >> 2];
const secondU32 = Memory.u32[(pointer + 4) >> 2];
```

It is **your responsibility** to ensure that you are using pointers correctly
and only accessing data you own. The allocator does not and cannot do bounds
checks on your memory access, so you will not be stopped from writing to memory
regions outside of your allocated range.

## Freeing

When you are done with your allocated section of memory, you must call `free()`.
**The allocator does not automatically garbage collect - you are responsible for
freeing memory you no longer need.** `free()` accepts a pointer, and allows that
section of memory to be allocated again.

```ts
import { memory } from 'thyseus';

const myPointer = Memory.alloc(8);
// ... some time later, when you're done with memory
Memory.free(myPointer);
// You may not use myPointer any more!
```

## Utilities

The `Memory` object also exposes a few additional functions for convenience.

-   `copy(from: Pointer, length: number, to: Pointer): void`, which accepts a
    pointer to start from, a length (in bytes) to copy, and the destination to
    copy data to.
-   `copyPointer(pointer: Pointer): Pointer`, which allocates a new pointer of
    the same size as `pointer`, copies data from `pointer`, and returns the
    newly allocated pointer.
-   `set(from: Pointer, length: number, value: number): void`, which sets a
    specified range to the specified `value`, starting at the provided `pointer`
    for the specified `length` (in bytes).

## Special Semantics

For ease of use, some memory functions have special semantics when called with
particular values.

-   Calling `free()` with 0 or the null pointer results in a no-op.
-   Calling `realloc()` with 0 or the null pointer is equivalent to calling
    `alloc()` with the specified number of bytes.
-   Calling `copyPointer()` with 0 or the null pointer simply returns the null
    pointer.
-   **_In dev only_**, calling `free()` or `realloc()` with a pointer that is
    not 8-byte aligned (i.e., an invalid pointer) results in an error being
    thrown.
-   **_In dev only_**, calling `reallocAt()` with a pointer that is not
    **_4-byte_** aligned results in an error being thrown.

In these cases, the "null pointer" refers to the allocator's internally held
null pointer, _not_ the Javascript `null` value.
