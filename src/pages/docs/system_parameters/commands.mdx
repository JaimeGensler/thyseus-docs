# Commands

Commands are used to spawn & despawn entities, add components to & remove
components from entities, and to clear event queues. Commands are _not_
processed immediately - instead, they are added to a queue, which is processed
in a system called `applyCommands`. The effects of commands are not observeable
until _after_ commands are processed!

By default, Thyseus adds `applyCommands` to the end of `CoreSchedule.Startup`
and `CoreSchedule.Main`; however, you can import `applyCommands` and add it to
whatever schedule you need, as many times as you need.

<Aside type="tip">
	`applyCommands` requires access to the World, and so will create a hard sync
	point for multithreading. Try to avoid adding it more than necessary!
</Aside>

Let's take a quick look at what we can do with `Commands`!

## Spawning Entities

```ts
function spawnEntities(commands: Commands) {
	const entityCommands = commands.spawn();
}
```
