# Thyseus

Thyseus is an Entity Component System (ECS) framework written in Typescript.
Taking much inspiration from [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/), it aims to provide
a best-in-class developer experience _without sacrificing performance_.

ECS is a data-oriented design approach to development - typically used for game
dev - that promotes modularity and reusability by separating data and behavior.
It consists of **entities**, which are unique identifiers; **components** which
are plain data without behavior; and **systems**, which operate on data. For a
good introduction to the paradigm, read the
[ECS FAQ](https://github.com/SanderMertens/ecs-faq) by Sander Mertens.

Thyseus is a powerful foundation for you to build your own complex applications
on that remains deeply configureable and composeable. It supports a number of
features out of the box, including:

-   A safety-first approach (no `eval` or eval-like constructs)
-   Hassle-free multithreading
-   Archetypal storage
-   Complex queries
-   Deeply customizable execution logic
-   Dynamically-sized types
-   World-unique data
-   Event handling
-   Fine-grain memory management
-   Integration with third-party libraries

Let's dive into it!
