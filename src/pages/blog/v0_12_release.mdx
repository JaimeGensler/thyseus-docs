# v0.12 Released

Hey there! Thanks for checking out the blog, showcasing the latest info on
what's happening with Thyseus. I hope you're enjoying the new design - this
fresh coat of paint also comes with a rewrite to much of the docs with a new,
(hopefully) clearer structure to them.

If you're new here, Thyseus is a multi-threadable and DX-focused archetypal
Entity Component System (ECS) written entirely in Typescript; head over to
[the docs](/docs) to learn more and get started.

v0.12.0 is Thyseus's biggest and most exciting update yet - huge shoutouts to
[3mcd](https://github.com/3mcd) (author of
[Javelin](https://github.com/3mcd/javelin)) and
[kayh](https://github.com/kayhhh) (author of
[Lattice](https://github.com/lattice-engine/lattice)) for their contributions,
without which this update wouldn't have been possible. Let's get into it!

## The Transformer

v0.12 is releasing alongside a sibling package - the Thyseus transformer! The
transformer has a number of potential uses, but for now it has a single job
(which we'll get to soon). It isn't required, but moving forward it will be
considered the "canonical" way to develop with Thyseus.

For its first release, **the transformer is available as either a Rollup plugin
or a Webpack plugin** and requires the use of Typescript. Please don't hesitate
to [open a request](https://github.com/JaimeGensler/thyseus-transformer/issues)
for a similar plugin for your bundler of choice.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Tabs items={['Rollup', 'Vite', 'Webpack']}>
	<Tabs.Panel>
		The Thyseus transformer for Rollup is a plugin. Install:

    	```sh
    	pnpm add typescript @thyseus/transformer-rollup
    	```

    	And configure:

    	```ts filename="rollup.config.js" {1,2,7,8}
    	import thyseusPlugin from 'thyseus-plugin';
    	import typescript from 'rollup-plugin-typescript2';

    	export default {
    		// ...
    		plugins: [
    			thyseusPlugin(),
    			typescript(),
    		],
    	};
    	```

    	Note that `thyseusPlugin()` **must** appear _before_ `typescript()` in order to work, as the plugin transpiles Typescript to Typescript.
    </Tabs.Panel>
    <Tabs.Panel>
    	The Thyseus transformer for Vite is a compatible Rollup plugin. Install:

    	```sh
    	pnpm add typescript @thyseus/transformer-rollup
    	```

    	And configure:

    	```ts filename="vite.config.ts" {2,5}
    	import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
    	import { thyseusPlugin } from '@thyseus/transformer-rollup';

    	export default defineConfig({
    		plugins: [thyseusPlugin()],
    	});
    	```
    </Tabs.Panel>
    <Tabs.Panel>
    	The Thyseus transformer for Webpack is a loader. Install:
    	```sh
    	pnpm add typescript @thyseus/transformer-webpack
    	```

    	And configure:

    	```js filename="webpack.config.js" {11-14}
    	module.exports = {
    		module: {
    			rules: [
    				{
    					test: /\.ts$/,
    					use: [
    						{
    							loader: 'ts-loader',
    							options: {},
    						},
    						{
    							loader: '@thyseus/transformer-webpack',
    							options: {},
    						},
    					],
    				},
    			],
    		},
    	};
    	```

    	Note that `@thyseus/transformer-webpack` **must** appear _after_ `ts-loader` in order to work, as the plugin transpiles Typescript to Typescript
    </Tabs.Panel>

</Tabs>

And you're good to go. Latest releases of Thyseus and the transformer will
always match versions, so update both!

## Systems

**Systems are now just functions** - `defineSystem()` has been removed, and you
don't need to fuss with parameter creators anymore. Type your systems and let
the transformer handle the rest!

```ts
// The classic example
function moveEntities(query: Query<[Mut<Position>, Velocity]>) {
	for (const [pos, vel] of query) {
		pos.x += vel.x;
		pos.y += vel.y;
		pos.z += vel.z;
	}
}

function spawnEntities(commands: Commands) {
	commands.spawn().addType(Position).addType(Velocity);
}

function handleLevelUps(eventReader: EventReader<LevelUpEvent>) {
	// ... whatever you need to do here
}

// ...later

const world = await World.new()
	// A teaser of what's coming up!
	.addSystems(moveEntities, spawnEntities, handleLevelUps)
	.build();
```

Yep, that just works. âœ¨

It's been a goal from the very beginning to provide this API, so we're pretty
stoked to have finally reached this milestone. Given this is the first version
of the transformer, it's possible that some bugs have made it in despite
rigorous testing; please
[report any issues](https://github.com/JaimeGensler/thyseus-transformer/issues/new)
you find.

The transformer also allows one-off transformation opt-outs - add a comment with
`thyseus-ignore` before the code you want preserved, and the transformer will
simply skip that node.

If you're wondering about custom system parameters, don't worry -
[we've got you covered](/docs/advanced_patterns/custom_system_parameters#transforming-system-parameters).

### Systems Without Transformation

The transformer adds a `parameters` property to your system functions for you.
The `parameters` property is an array of system parameter descriptors; worlds
read these descriptors to determine what arguments to supply to the system. If
you're opting out of system transformation, systems are still easy to write -
just add the `parameters` property and create the descriptors yourself.

```js
// New import specifically for descriptors
import { ResourceDescriptor } from 'thyseus/descriptors';
import { MyResourceType } from './somewhere';

export function mySystem(resource) {}
mySystem.parameters = [ResourceDescriptor(MyResourceType)];
```

### Usage Notes

If you're using the transformer, there are a couple things to note.

-   **Only function declarations and functions in variable initialization are
    transformed.** Function expressions passed inline to other functions won't
    be transformed, but you can always provide parameters manually.

```ts
// This works great!
function systemA(world: World) {}

// This too!
const systemB = function systemBInner(world: World) {};

// And of course we wouldn't forget about arrow functions!
const systemC = (world: World) => {};
```

-   **Type aliases (including import aliases) are not permitted;** simple
    aliases (`type MyQuery = Query<...>`), or "namespaced" types
    (`Thyseus.Commands`) will not be transformed. Don't worry - we plan to add
    support in the future!
-   **Functions with rest parameters will not be transformed,** even if the
    parameters are typed as a tuple containing only valid system parameters.
-   **Import classes, not just types.** When using class types, the transformer
    assumes the actual class is in scope; if you get a reference error, it's
    probably this.
-   **Systems can't be generic.** Of course, you can still create generic "base"
    functions and call them in systems with your non-generic data.
-   **Functions that accept only system parameters will have a `parameters`
    property added.** This is more-or-less harmless; you can ignore or
    `//thyseus-ignore` it - up to you!

## Types

With the changes to systems, we've made sure to **export all Thyseus types**.
Even better, you have _two_ options for types: direct imports or a global type
injection. The choice of which of these you use is up to you - the docs assume
global type imports for the sake of brevity.

### Direct Type Imports

Don't want a library injecting its types into the global scope? We get it - by
default, Thyseus **does not** add types to the global scope. Import directly
from `'thyseus'` for all your type needs:

```ts
import type { Commands, SystemRes } from 'thyseus';

function mySystem(
	commands: Commands,
	localData: SystemRes<Map<object, object>>,
) {}
```

### Global Type Injection

Tired of writing imports? Me too. Import `'thyseus/types'` (we recommend a
`src/thyseusGlobals.d.ts` file) and all Thyseus types will be available anywhere
in your project:

```ts filename="src/thyseusGlobals.d.ts"
import 'thyseus/types';
```

## Schedules

System scheduling has needed a revamp for a while. It's become clear that a
single `update()` method is lackluster DX. Worse, it fails to make it clear,
easy, or in some cases _possible_ to incorporate patterns like fixed updates or
custom execution logic. As is the trend with Thyseus' development, we took
inspiration from [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) and their stagless update to
rethink this API.

**Introducing Schedules!**

A schedule is a collection of systems. Every schedule has a dedicated executor,
which means **each schedule can use a different executor**. When a schedule is
run, _all_ systems in that schedule must complete their execution before another
schedule can be run. However, schedules may contain systems that run _other
schedules_ inside them. A schedule is labeled by a `Symbol()` - Thyseus provides
two schedules by default, and you're encouraged to create more as you need!

### Adding Systems

We've removed `WorldBuilder.addSystem()` and `WorldBuilder.addStartupSystem()`
in favor of more versatile and more descriptive methods:
`WorldBuiler.addSystems()` (notice the **s**) and
`WorldBuilder.addSystemsToSchedule()`.

As the name implies, `addSystems()` can add multiple systems at once.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```ts
import { World } from 'thyseus';
import { systemA, systemB, systemC } from './systems';

export const myWorld = await World.new()
	.addSystems(
		systemA, 
		systemB, 
		systemC
	)
	.build();
```

`addSystems()` adds systems to the "default" schedule (`DefaultSchedule`). If
you want to add systems into a different schedule, you can use
`addSystemsToSchedule()`. Simply pass the unique symbol for your schedule as the
first argument and your systems as the remaining arguments.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```ts
import { World } from 'thyseus';
import { 
	spawnEntities,
	physicsA, 
	physicsB, 
	physicsC 
	FixedUpdateSchedule, 
	StartupSchedule
} from './systems';

export const myWorld = await World.new()
	.addSystemsToSchedule(
		StartupSchedule,
		spawnEntities
	)
	.addSystemsToSchedule(
		FixedUpdateSchedule, 
		physicsA, 
		physicsB, 
		physicsC,
	)
	.build();
```

### Running Schedules

`world.update()` has been removed and replaced with two new methods!

`world.runSchedule(schedule: symbol): Promise<void>` runs a single schedule. It
returns a promise that only resolves when every system in that schedule has
completed executing. You must await this promise before calling
`world.runSchedule()` again in the same scope.

`world.start()` runs the `StartSchedule`. Systems in this schedule should be
responsible for starting up your app and establishing loops to execute _other_
schedules in. If you're migrating to `v0.12.0`, it's recommended you move your
game loop logic to a system and add it to this schedule! `world.start()` comes
with the added bonus that **it can safely be called from any thread** -
internally, it only kicks off execution on the main thread.

## System dependencies

The system dependency API has been overhauled again. The old API had too many
confusing gotchas, like potentially different results depending on where you
called `before()` and ignoring ordering constraints if it thought the order was
unobservable. The new API allows clearer, more predictable dependencies and
**always respects them**.

### `run()`

Dependencies are now declared with a new `run()` function. Pass it a system and
it returns a `SystemConfig` object, which can be used to specify ordering
constraints (and in the future, even more).

```ts
import { World, run } from 'thyseus';
import { systemA, systemB, systemC } from './systems';

export const myWorld = await World.new()
	.addSystems(
		run(systemA).before(systemB),
		systemB,
		run(systemC).after(systemB),
	)
	.build();
```

Reads like a book!

Note that you're only actually adding the single system that `run()` wraps.
`SystemConfig` includes methods for `before()`, `after()`, `first()` and
`last()`. The new API also has one more trick up its sleeve to make the above
pattern a little simpler:

```ts
import { World, run } from 'thyseus';
import { systemA, systemB, systemC } from './systems';

export const myWorld = await World.new()
	.addSystems(...run.chain(systemA, systemB, systemC))
	.build();
```

`run.chain()` creates an ordering where the systems must run in the order passed
to the `chain` function - in the above case, `systemA`, then `systemB`, then
`systemC`.

## Other changes

### applyCommands

The `applyCommands` system **is no longer added by default**. Handling commands
at the end of `DefaultSchedule` isn't the right choice for every app built with
Thyseus, and `WorldBuilder` is designed to be append-only. This adds some
friction in getting started with Thyseus, but if you'd like the old behavior you
can simply import and add `applyCommands`!

### World configuration

The `memory` option has been renamed to `memorySize` to be more descriptive of
what the option controls.

You can now use the `useSharedMemory: boolean` option to force the use of
`SharedArrayBuffer` for single-threaded worlds. When set to true,
`isSecureContext` must be true, but you don't need to pass a worker URL. This
option is ignored for multithreading. The default is `false`.

You can also now specify whether the current thread is the main thread with
`isMainThread: boolean`, which should make Thyseus more useable in non-browser
environments. The default for this option is a browser-oriented main-thread
check: `typeof document !== 'undefined'`.

### `cloneSystem()`

A `cloneSystem()` function has been added, in case you'd like to re-use the same
system within a schedule. This function **does not** preserve the `this` value
of your function.

### `Optional` Queries Disabled

Optional queries have been temporarily removed. The plan is to add support for
them again in a not-far-off patch, but for this release they added too much
complexity for a comparatively niche feature.

### Tables

`table.size` has been renamed to `table.length`. Moving forward we're
standardizing around using "length" to denote the number of items in a structure
and "size" to denote the size (in bytes) of a structure.

`table.bitfield` has also been renamed to `table.archetype`, and
`world.archetypes` has been renamed to `world.tables`. There's a conceptual
distinction between tables and archetypes, and these new names should help
clarify that.

Tables are no longer constructed on worker threads. This probably doesn't mean
much to you unless you previously tried to access tables on threads. Table
_data_ is still accessible from any thread and queries have been refactored to
not need table instances so that they may still run on all threads.

### Removal of `definePlugin()`

The inclusion of this function in the first place was a little silly, to be
honest - its sole purpose was to provide type help for writing plugins, but
plugins are already really, _really_ easy to type correctly.

```ts
import type { WorldBuilder } from 'thyseus';

// This is all there is to it!
function yourPlugin(builder: WorldBuilder) {
	// ...
}
```

### Removal of `createThreadChannel()`

Internally, we've removed the need for creating thread message channels. While
it's possible this need will return, the current API isn't really up to our
standards and so has been removed for the time being. If you still need a way of
creating thread message channels, it's thread-safe to add handlers directly
after building a world.

### Entity component

The `Entity` component now has a `hasComponent(componentType: Struct)` method to
check if an entity has a component! Currently, this check only works for queries
running on the main thread.

The `Entity` component will also throw an error if you try to construct it
without passing `world.commands` and `world.entities`. This is most likely to
occur if you're trying to use it as a sub-component, which unfortunately is not
supported at the moment.

### Preservation of Identifiers

Build output has been modified so that identifier names are preserved, which
should make debugging and inspecting Thyseus' internal classes/functions a
little nicer.

### `Memory` API

The `Memory` API has been exposed. A docs page has been added on how to use it -
the TL;DR is **don't**.

## What's next?

Moving forward, the goal will be to make small but (more) frequent updates. Some
of these updates will hone in on performance - while Thyseus has been
architected with performance in mind from the beginning, we've been so focused
on feature work that we haven't been able to push that architecture to its full
potential. At the same time, I'm aiming to improve some of the internal
architecture - as Thyseus sees more contributors, it's increasingly important
that the internal APIs are as easy to use as the external.

Of course, I'd love to hear what _you_ want! If you'd like to see something in
particular worked on - whether it's a feature or performance/stability
improvements - just
[open a ticket](https://github.com/JaimeGensler/thyseus/issues/new/choose) or
head to the `#thyseus` channel in the
[Web-ECS Discord](https://discord.gg/T3g8U89qqZ) and let us know what's
important to you.

While a 1.0 release is still a little way off, I'm more optimistic than ever
about the future of Thyseus. For the time being, enjoy v0.12.0!
