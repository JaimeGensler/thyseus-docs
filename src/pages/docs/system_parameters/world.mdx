# World

On occasion, you may need access to the `World` itself. For this reason, Thyseus
also provides a `World` system parameter. In general, it is best to avoid
accessing the world itself - most APIs that require direct access to the world
are low-level and difficult to use correctly. Additionally, accessing the world
creates a hard sync point when multithreading - no other system can run while
the world is being accessed.

All data in the world is public.

The most common use case for accessing the world is running a custom schedule:

```ts
import { MySchedule } from './somewhere';

async function mySystem(world: World) {
	const someCondition = true; // Complex logic here
	if (someCondition) {
		await world.runSchedule(MySchedule);
	}
}
```

When your system requires access to the world, **you are guaranteed to always
access the world from the main thread**. World instances constructed in threads
do not have access to all data (e.g., mainthread-only resources) and do not have
the ability to communicate with threads other than the main thread.
Additionally, most world methods depend on being called only on the main thread!
