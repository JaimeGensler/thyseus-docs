# Installation & Setup

To get started with Thyseus, you'll need to create a new project or add it to an
existing one. If you're starting a new project, we highly recommend using
[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as your bundler - in the future, we will likely
release a plugin for Vite that improves performance and DX.

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'yarn', 'npm']}>
	<Tab>
		```sh copy
		pnpm add thyseus typescript
		```
	</Tab>
		<Tab>
		```sh copy
		yarn add thyseus typescript
		```
	</Tab>
	<Tab>
		```sh copy
		npm i thyseus typescript
		```
	</Tab>
</Tabs>

Thyseus makes use of decorators, and so requires Typescript as well. These
decorators will be upgraded to the new ES decorators once Typescript 5 is
released, so Typescript 5 will soon be the minimum version.

## Performance & Production Builds

Thyseus uses [`esm-env`](https://github.com/benmccann/esm-env) to determine
whether you're building your app for development or production. Dev builds have
a number of additional correctness checks and validations that help you make
sure your app works correctly and doesn't throw errors (or throws easily
debuggable errors). These checks come at the cost of speed, so for production
builds these checks are stripped out.
