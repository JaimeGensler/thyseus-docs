# v0.14.0 Released

Welcome back to another release blog!

If you're new here, Thyseus is an archetypal Entity Component System (ECS) aimed
at providing a best-in-class developer experience with blazing-fast performance.
Get started or upgrade with:

```sh
pnpm add thyseus@latest
pnpm add -D @thyseus/rollup-plugin-thyseus@latest
```

This update has been in the works for quite some time - I had the original idea
for it nearly a year ago, but I had planned to push it off to be a post-1.0
exploration. Feeling dissatisfied with certain parts of the API, I decided to
investigate it sooner to see if it was feasible & performant; that investigation
turned out extremely successful!

This is without a doubt my personal favorite update to Thyseus; it introduces a
more readable API, performance improvements, some new highly-requested features,
and less code both for you to write _and_ in the core library. Did I mention
these were all the same change?

## Serialized Structs

Structs (i.e., components) were fast becoming the largest weakpoint in Thyseus's
API. Representing components as classes has a lot of upsides, but `@struct` has
started to feel a bit like a minefield with the numerous conditions on how and
when they can be used. To name some of their limitations:

-   Typescript users have to provide type information twice (once with
    `@struct`, once with TS types).
-   The permitted field types are very limited.
-   Classes can't be meaningfully extended.
-   You have to handle custom initialization (`initStruct()`).
-   Lifetimes have to be considered when you create instances (`dropStruct()`).
-   There are many cases where you can't even construct them.

This is far from the developer experience we're trying to provide. In an ideal
world, components in a Typescript ECS should be expressed as classes like any
other, no caveats or gotchas.

**So, why not?**

```ts
import { struct } from 'thyseus';

@struct
class Vec3 {
	x: number = 0;
	y: number = 0;
	z: number = 0;
}
```

Decorate a class with `@struct`, type your fields, and you're done. âœ¨

This new API is made possible by the Thyseus transformer. The decorator is a
no-op that gets stripped from builds; it's only needed to let the transformer
know a class should be transformed. As a bonus, the `@struct` decorator is now
overloaded and can work as either a legacy decorator _or_ a new ES decorator -
go ahead and remove `"experimentalDecorators": true`.

Behind this new API is a fundamental change to the way structs work. Rather than
using accessors and directly mutating values in memory, struct properties are
_normal properties_; values are copied from memory into an instance, mutated as
needed, then written back to memory. Thanks to some clever tricks applied in
systems, this approach is equivalent in performance to _handwriting_ structs
(i.e., without decorators) in previous versions of Thyseus, which is usually
anywhere from \~1.5x to 15x faster than decorated structs.

All of this means the core functionality of your classes remain intact so **what
you see is what you get**; structs behave just like any other class, and you can
leave the tedious work of creating the few extra properties that Thyseus needs
to the transformer. Better yet, the serialization model unlocks a _ton_ of
potential for structs.

That's right - we're just getting started.

### Types

The new struct API allows the same fine-grain control over types as the previous
API. Thyseus exports all the numeric types you're used to - the types themselves
are just aliases for `number` (`bigint` for `u64`/`i64`), but the transformer
will use the narrower type for serializing/deserializing fields. It also permits
the use of plain ol' `number`, which functions identically to `f64`.

```ts
@struct
class SomePrimitives {
	a: u8;
	b: i16;
	c: u32;
	d: f64;
	e: number; // Same as f64
	f: boolean; // Booleans still allowed, of course!
}
```

The previous complex types are still around in some form as well, with
**strings**, **tuples** (fixed-size same-type arrays), and **other structs**!

```ts
@struct
class Player {
	name: string; // Normal string type
	color: [u8, u8, u8, u8]; // [r, g, b, a]
	id: Entity; // The entity component
}
```

**Numeric enums** are also permitted (string enums are _not_) and will be
serialized as the best found numeric match.

```ts
enum Status {
	Pending,
	Resolved,
	Rejected,
}

@struct
class PromiseLike {
	status: Status = Status.Pending; // serialized as a u8
}
```

Neat! How about some new types - like **arrays**?

```ts
@struct
class SomeComponent {
	myArray: f32[]; // Array<f32> is also permitted!
}
```

No custom abstraction, no wrapper over every access - just the JS arrays you're
used to. Arrays must contain same-type numerics, but unlike tuples they can have
a variable number of elements in them.

Serialization opens the door to all of this. For the first iteration, the focus
has been on retaining old functionality and introducing just a couple
highly-requested features. In the future, we'll extend the available types;
pretty much anything you can safely serialize & deserialize is possible, so feel
free to open a ticket!

### Construction & Destruction

In previous versions of Thyseus, structs had to call `initStruct()` in the
constructor to perform some setup. They also couldn't be constructed in module
scope if you needed a local instance - if you tried this, you probably saw an
error about how `Memory` needed to be initialized. By far the worst of all,
structs required consumers to be familiar with the idea of lifetimes and to
consider when to call `dropStruct()`.

With serialization, none of this is necessary - **`initStruct()` and
`dropStruct()` have been removed**. You can create instances whenever you want,
and because structs behave like any other class you can forget about lifetimes!

You can also specify default values without a constructor:

```ts
@struct
class Vec3 {
	// Define defaults here, if you'd like!
	x: f64 = 0;
	y: f64 = 0;
	z: f64 = 0;
}
```

Note that because fields are now plain object properties, you will see
Typescript errors if you don't provide _some_ form of field initialization for
your structs.

The only requirement left is that structs being used as components or resources
may only have optional constructor arguments (Thyseus needs to construct
instances somehow!). However, structs that are only ever used as substructs may
have required constructor arguments.

### Inheritance

Inheritance needed some love, too. To recap, previously extension was permitted
so long as new fields weren't added. We can do better though; with
serialization, **extension is permitted without restriction**.

```ts
import { struct } from 'thyseus';

@struct
class Vec2 {
	x: f64;
	y: f64;
}
@struct
class Vec3 extends Vec2 {
	z: f64;
}
@struct
class Vec4 extends Vec3 {
	w: f64;
}

class Quat extends Vec4 {}
```

If you add fields to an extended class, you'll still need to decorate it with
`@struct`. If you don't add fields, the decorator is optional.

### Usage Notes

Here's some general usage notes to keep in mind:

-   (Silent) **Early returns in queries/systems will cause structs to not be
    correctly serialized**. You can call `serialize()` yourself if needed here.
    -   This will be fixed in a future update, but I didn't want to further
        block the release on this.
-   (Throws) **All fields on `@struct` classes must define _explicit_ types**,
    even if they assign a default value.
-   (Throws) **Types not mentioned above (or in the docs) are not permitted**.
    This includes aliases, similar to system parameters.
-   (Silent) `static`, `readonly`, `declare`, `abstract`, and accessor fields
    are ignored.
-   (Silent) Classes decorated with `@struct` will have `serialize()`,
    `deserialize()`, `static size`, `static alignment`, and `static drop()`
    properties overridden if they exist.

### Under The Hood

As mentioned, this is all powered by the transformer. The transformer reads the
types of your struct properties and generates highly efficient
serialization/deserialization methods for structs based on those properties.
This allows the same powerful control over Memory you're used to while also
enabling the use of familiar JS constructs like arrays.

In order to achieve the best performance possible, the transformer must also
assume the responsibility of _creating_ serialization calls. Systems that use
resources/system resources and `for...of` loops for queries have
`serialize()`/`deserialize()` calls inserted at the beginning & end of the
scope. This insertion allows VMs to get much more clever and improves
performance by an order of magnitude.

As a final bonus, all these changes mean structs aren't turned into anonymous
classes anymore, making debugging _much_ easier.

## Other Changes

### Bundler Plugin Name Changes

For this version, **the rollup plugin for Thyseus has been renamed** to be more
inline with the rest of the rollup plugin ecosystem; the rollup plugin is
available as `@thyseus/rollup-plugin-thyseus`.

I've also decided to scale back on bundler plugins for the time being -
supporting both rollup and webpack was proving tedious without clear community
need for webpack support. `@thyseus/typescript-transformer` is still available
for usage and can be configured to work with any bundler that allows you to
transform source code or add typescript transformers.

### `Entity.prototype.is()`

The entity component now has an `is()` method that you can use to check if two
entities are the same. Internally it's just a simple comparison of index &
generation, but it's a small readability boon and sidesteps any questions of
potential object creation that comes with comparing entity `id`s (bigints,
yarr!).

### Events

`EventWriter.create()` has taken the signature of `EventWriter.createFrom()`,
and `EventWriter.createFrom()` has been removed. Serialization makes returning
mutable handles less necessary as a pattern. Recycling instances is still
perfectly acceptable as data is still immediately copied - feel free to handle
this locally!

Events have also been reworked to use 50% less memory (from the `Memory` API)
for their internal metadata.

### Commands

Commands have been reworked to differentiate `Add` and `AddType` commands when
enqueueing commands, resulting in a significant reduction in the memory needed
to store `AddType` commands.

### World Config & Node Support

When running in non-browser environments, Thyseus previously required you
provide `isMainThread` config to worlds to determine if they're being built in
the main thread or a worker thread. While this requirement remains in place for
multithreaded worlds, Thyseus now defaults `isMainThread` to `true` when using
only one thread, making it easier to get started in non-browser environments.

### Queries

The `forEach()` method on queries has been removed - having multiple methods of
iteration adds little to no value in this case while increasing our maintenance
burden.

## A Note On Javascript Support

Type information is - and always has been - a core part of the API. When
designing the "canonical" way to develop with Thyseus, it makes the most sense
to simply lean into the power of Typescript's type system, rather than creating
unfamiliar, more verbose, and less useful ways of describing types. Ultimately,
this should provide the best DX and allow us to leverage compiler optimizations
to make Thyseus as fast as possible.

That said, we'd still like to provide a path forward for those that wish to use
Thyseus without Typescript. Given Thyseus is more-or-less a one-person effort
right now, this isn't as much of a priority; however, it _is_ on the roadmap,
and contributions on this front are more than welcome!

## What's Next?

This is most likely the last large breaking change Thyseus will see for quite
some time - the current roadmap is mostly just minor improvements, cleanup, and
performance improvements. It's my hope that Thyseus will land in a spot
relatively soon where there will be no more breaking changes being considered -
at that point, we'll be nearing a 1.0 release!

The next release should follow quickly and will (probably) focus on some small
cleanup up for the query filter API to make them filters easier to write &
parse, alongside some other miscellaneous improvements.

With nothing substantial on the horizon, it's the perfect time to request
anything that you'd like to see added or changed in Thyseus. Any performance
issues you've spotted, parts of the API that feel clunky, or something new -
whatever will make you more productive with Thyseus! As always, you can start a
conversation on [github](https://github.com/JaimeGensler/thyseus) or in the
`#thyseus` channel of the Web ECS [discord](https://discord.gg/T3g8U89qqZ).

Cheers, and until next time!
