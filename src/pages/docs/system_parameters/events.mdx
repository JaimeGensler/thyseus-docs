# Events

Events allow you to run logic in response to something that happened in your
game, and can be used as a means of cross-system communication. Events are
instances of classes and live in a queue of other events of the same type. New
events can be pushed to the queue with `EventWriter<T>`, and events in the queue
can be read with `EventReader<T>`.

**Events have no set lifetime** - they will persist until the queue is manually
cleared. Writers can call the `clear()` method to remove all events from the
current queue, or you can add the `clearAllEventQueues` system to your schedule!

## `EventReader`

`EventReader`s are responsible for reading data from the event queue.

They can be iterated over in a `for...of` loop, and will yield instances of the
event type. You can also check their `length` to determine the number of
elements in the queue.

```ts
class LevelUpEvent {
	level: number = 0;
}

export function readLevelUpEvents(
	levelUpEvents: EventReader<LevelUpEvent>,
	audio: Res<Audio>,
) {
	if (levelUpEvents.length === 0) {
		return;
	}
	for (const luEvent of levelUpEvents) {
		if (luEvent.level % 10 === 0) {
			audio.playSuperCoolSound();
		} else {
			audio.playLessCoolSound();
		}
	}

	levelUpEvents.clear();
}
```

## `EventWriter`

`EventWriter` inherits all functionality of `EventReader`, and is also
responsible for adding events to the queue. You can add events to the queue with
`create(value: T): void`, which simply pushes the provided value to the queue.
**The passed `value` must be an instance of the class**.

`EventWriter`s can also call `clearImmediate()` to immediately remove all events
from the queue.

```ts
class LevelUpEvent {
	level: number = 0;
}

export function writeLevelUpEvents(levelUpEvents: EventWriter<LevelUpEvent>) {
	levelUpEvents.createDefault();
	console.log(levelUpEvents.length); // -> 1

	// A clear command has been queued, but events still exist.
	levelUpEvents.clear();
	console.log(levelUpEvents.length); // -> 1

	// Now we're removing events immediately.
	levelUpEvents.clearImmediate();
	console.log(levelUpEvents.length); // -> 0
}
```
