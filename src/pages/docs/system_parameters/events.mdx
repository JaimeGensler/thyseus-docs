# Events

Events allow you to run logic in response to something that happened in your
game, and can be used as a means of cross-system communication. Events are
instances of `Struct`s, and live in a queue of other events of the same type.
New events can be pushed to the queue with `EventWriter<T>`, and events in the
queue can be read with `EventReader<T>`.

Events have no set lifetime - they will persist until the queue is manually
cleared. Both readers and writers can call the `clear()` method to queue a
command that will empty the event queue the next time commands are processed.
This only clears events of the queue's event type, and not queues for other
event types.

## `EventReader`

`EventReader`s are responsible for reading data from the event queue.

They can be iterated over in a `for...of` loop, and will yield instances of the
event type (`Readonly<T>`). You can also check their `length` to determine the
number of elements in the queue.

```ts
import { struct } from 'thyseus';

@struct
class LevelUpEvent {
	@struct.u32 declare level: number;
}

export function readLevelUpEvents(
	levelUpEvents: EventReader<LevelUpEvent>,
	audio: Res<Audio>,
) {
	if (levelUpEvents.length === 0) {
		return;
	}
	for (const luEvent of levelUpEvents) {
		if (luEvent.level % 10 === 0) {
			audio.playSuperCoolSound();
		} else {
			audio.playLessCoolSound();
		}
	}

	levelUpEvents.clear();
}
```

	Beware! The **same object** is yielded for every iteration of the `for...of`
	loop, with different backing data.
</Aside>

## `EventWriter`

`EventWriter`s are responsible for adding events to the queue. There are three
provided methods of doing so:

1. `createDefault(): void` adds an element to the queue with the default data
   for that struct.
2. `create(): T` adds an element to the queue and returns a handle to that
   element for you to mutate.
3. `createFrom(instance: T): void` copies the data from passed instance of the
   struct into the queue.

`EventWriter`s also have a `clearImmediate()` method that immediately clears all
events in the queue.

```ts
import { struct } from 'thyseus';

@struct
class LevelUpEvent {
	@struct.u32 declare level: number;
}

export function writeLevelUpEvents(levelUpEvents: EventWriter<LevelUpEvent>) {
	levelUpEvents.createDefault();
	console.log(levelUpEvents.length); // -> 1

	// A clear command has been queued, but events still exist.
	levelUpEvents.clear();
	console.log(levelUpEvents.length); // -> 1

	// Now we're removing events immediately.
	levelUpEvents.clearImmediate();
	console.log(levelUpEvents.length); // -> 0
}
```

`EventWriter` extends `EventReader`, and so also has all of functionality of
readers.

## Parallelism

As one may expect, `EventWriter`s require exclusive access to queues, and so
intersect with readers and writers of the same queue. `EventReader`s do _not_
require exclusive access, and so can run in parallel with other readers of the
same queue.
