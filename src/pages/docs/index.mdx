# Thyseus

Thyseus is an Entity Component System (ECS) framework written in Typescript.
Taking much inspiration from [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/), it aims to provide
a best-in-class developer experience without sacrificing performance.

ECS is a data-oriented design approach to development typically found in games
that promotes modularity and reusability by separating data and behavior. It
consists of **entities**, which are unique identifiers; **components** which are
plain data; and **systems**, which operate on data. For a good introduction to
the paradigm, read the [ECS FAQ](https://github.com/SanderMertens/ecs-faq) by
Sander Mertens.

Thyseus is a powerful foundation for you to build your own complex applications
on that remains deeply configureable and composeable. It supports a number of
features out of the box, including:

-   Effortless integration with third-party libraries like
    [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/).
-   Archetypal storage for lean memory use and cache-friendly iteration.
-   Complex queries with filters like `Maybe`, `And`, `Or`, `With`, and
    `Without`.
-   First class support for Resources (singletons) and Events.
-   Boilerplate-free and safety-first worker thread support - no `eval()`!
-   Deeply customizable execution logic for easy handling of patterns like fixed
    updates.

Let's dive into it!
