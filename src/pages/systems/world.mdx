# World

On rare occasions, you may need access to the world itself. For this, Thyseus
provides the `World` descriptor. In general, it is best to avoid accessing the
world itself - most APIs that require direct access to the world are low-level
and difficult to use correctly.

For multithreading, accessing the World creates a hard sync point - no other
system can run while the world is running. The world is also **always accessed
from the main thread** - worlds in threads do not have access to all data, or
the ability to communicate with threads other than the main thread.
