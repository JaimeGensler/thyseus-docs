# Entities

Entities can represent any concrete "thing" in your game world; players,
enemies, items, the game level itself, even parts of the UI - all entities.
Conceptually, an entity is simply an empty container for any number of
**components**, and contains no special properties, data, or meaning on its own.
In practice, an entity is nothing more than an integer id.

Because entities contain no inherent data or meaning, it's not particularly
common to deal with them directly; instead, you'll usually interact with
_components_, the data that belongs to an entity.

## Creating Entities

New entities can be created using `Commands`. We'll cover systems and the
`Commands` API more in the future - for now, we'll write some _very_ simple
systems to show you how to work with entities!

```ts
function spawnEntity(commands: Commands) {
	const entity = commands.spawn();
	console.log(entity.id); // This will always be a (u64) bigint.
}
```

This is a basic system that accepts the `Commands` object. `commands.spawn()`
_queues_ an entity to be spawned and returns an `EntityCommands` object. This
object can be used to queue additional commands to insert (or remove) components
for that entity. It also provides a getter to see the id of the newly spawned
entity.

**Entities are not created immediately**. Instead, `Commands` reserves an id and
adds the entity creation request to a queue. Entities are created later when the
`applyCommands` system runs, which drains the queue of all commands. Created
entities are not observable until _after_ commands have been applied!

## Accessing Entities

Every entity possesses a special `Entity` component. This component allows you
to access the entity's index, generation, and id, and can be queried for in
systems (_queries will be covered more later, too!_).

```ts
import { Entity } from 'thyseus';

// This query matches every living entity!
function logAllEntityIds(query: Query<Entity>) {
	for (const entity of query) {
		console.log(entity.id);
	}
}
```

Every Entity's `Entity` component is unique - if you'd like to access that
entity later, you can hold onto the object. It also contains an `isAlive` field
that can be used to check liveliness at any point. Once the entity has been
despawned, `isAlive` will be false.

## Destroying Entities

Of course, not all entities will live forever. You can use `Commands` or
`EntityCommands` to queue an entity for destruction; **just like creation,
entities are not destroyed until the `applyCommands()` system runs**!

```ts
function destroyAllEntities(commands: Commands, allEntities: Query<Entity>) {
	for (const entity of allEntities) {
		// Use the whole entity
		commands.despawn(entity);
		// Or the id, if that's all you had
		commands.despawnById(entity.id);
	}
}
```
