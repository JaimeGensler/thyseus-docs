# Thyseus

Thyseus is an Entity Component System (ECS) framework written in Typescript.
Taking much inspiration from [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/), it aims to provide
a best-in-class developer experience without sacrificing performance.

ECS is a data-oriented design approach typically used for game development that
promotes modularity and reusability by separating data and behavior. It consists
of **entities**, which are unique identifiers; **components** which is plain
data without behavior; and **systems**, which operate on ECS data.
