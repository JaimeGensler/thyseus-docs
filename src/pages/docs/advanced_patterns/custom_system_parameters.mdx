# Custom System Parameters

Thyseus' system parameters are designed so that it is simple to write your own.
Parameters are responsible for declaring how they interact with other parameters
and what data they need from the world - as a result, just about anything
Thyseus can do internally, you can do, too! System parameters start with
**system parameter descriptors**.

## What is a system parameter descriptor?

As far as Thyseus is concerned, a system parameter descriptor - the items in the
`yourSystem.parameters` array - is simply an object that contains the following
four methods:

-   `isLocalToThread(): boolean`
-   `intersectsWith(other: object): boolean`
-   `onAddSystem(builder: WorldBuilder): void`
-   `intoArgument(world: World): any`

We'll dive into each of these methods and what they do before getting into how
to write our own descriptors.

### `isLocalToThread(): boolean`

This determines whether this parameter may only be accessed from the main
thread. Descriptors should return `true` if the parameter is only available from
the main thread, and `false` if the parameter is available on any thread.
Usually descriptors will either always return true or always return false, but
sometimes this is dependent on the provided data!

### `intersectsWith(other: object): boolean`

This method is called with other parameter descriptors, and is used to determine
if other parameters intersect with or are disjoint with this parameter. If
parameters intersect (`true` is returned), the systems they belong to will be
marked as intersecting, and cannot run in parallel. If they are disjoint
(`false` is returned), the systems _may_ run in parallel.

`intersectsWith` **does not** need to be symmetric; both descriptors are called
with each other, and if either returns true they are marked as intersecting.

### `onAddSystem(builder: WorldBuilder): void`

This method is called when a system is added by a `WorldBuilder` instance. It is
called with the WorldBuilder that added it, and allows the descriptor to do
whatever it may need with the builder - anything from adding plugins to
registering types. For some descriptors (e.g., `WorldDescriptor`), this function
is a no-op.

### `intoArgument(world: World): any`

This method is passed the world building the system, and whatever is returned
from this method will be passed to systems when they are called. This method may
return **anything**.

<Callout type="note">
	Promises returned by `intoArgument(world: World): any` will be `await`ed
	before systems are called!
</Callout>

## Recreating `Res`

Let's dive into the internal implementation of `ResourceDescriptor` to get a
feel for how these methods might work.

### Construction

First, we'll need a class that creates our descriptor objects. For parameter
descriptors to work with the transformer, parameter descriptors must be
implemented as classes, as the transformer will try to `new` them.

To get started with resources, we really just need to know the type (or class)
of the resource:

```ts
class ResourceDescriptor {
	resource: Class;
	constructor(resource: Class) {
		this.resource = resource;
	}
}
```

That's a nice start! Let's try adding some descriptor methods.

### `onAddSystem` for Resources

First, we need to know what the builder should do when it comes across this
descriptor. Resources in Thyseus are a first-class concept, so all we'll need to
do is register that we have a (potentially) new resource!

```ts
class ResourceDescriptor {
	onAddSystem(builder: WorldBuilder) {
		builder.registerResource(this.resource);
	}
}
```

The builder handles deduping types, so that's it for our responsibilities. Other
descriptors may need to add systems to work correctly, or to register
components, or more.

### Resource Thread Locality

Resources in Thyseus are allowed to be either mainthread-only or shareable
across threads. Thyseus allows shared data with `Struct`s; if a class is
correctly implemented as a `Struct`, then we should be able to share it across
threads. If not, then we'll only be able to access the data from the main
thread.

So how do we know a class is a struct? Well, there's an internal utility for
this:

```ts
function isStruct(val: unknown): val is Struct {
	return (
		typeof val === 'function' &&
		typeof val.size === 'number' &&
		typeof val.alignment === 'number'
	);
}
```

Structs are very simple, from Thyseus' perspective - classes (functions) with
static `size` and `alignment` properties.

Okay! Now to use this in our descriptor class:

```ts
class ResourceDescriptor {
	// ...

	isLocalToThread() {
		// Remember - this method asks if the parameter _IS_ local to the thread!
		// If our resource IS a struct, then it is NOT local to the thread
		// If it is NOT a struct, then it IS local to the thread.
		return !isStruct(this.resource);
	}
}
```

### Parameter intersection

Now we've made it to a trickier concept - parameter intersection. We need to
know if parameters intersect to determine whether systems may run in parallel.
In general, it is safe for two (or more) systems to read the same data at the
same time. However, if a system _writes_ data, it is no longer safe for a
different system to read or write that data.

But wait - we don't even know if we're reading or writing data! We'll need to
revise our constructor a little bit to make sure we know what we're doing with
the data we access.

There's a number of approaches we could take here. One would be to accept a
second argument, perhaps a boolean indicating whether our data should be
readonly or not. Another would be to split our descriptor into two, perhaps a
`ResourceDescriptor` and `MutableResourceDescriptor`. Either of these would be a
perfectly valid approach - however, Thyseus already includes a `Mut<T>` utility
for queries to denote whether they access a component mutably or not. For the
sake of a consistent API, we'll mirror that for resources. Our new constructor
then might look like this:

```ts
class ResourceDescriptor {
	resource: Class;
	canWrite: boolean;

	constructor(resource: Class | Mut<any>) {
		// Mut is a class, so we can use instanceof
		const isMut = resource instanceof Mut;
		// Mut instances just have a value property, containing the wrapped class.
		this.resource = isMut ? resource.value : resource;
		this.canWrite = isMut;
	}
}
```

Great! Now we know if we're reading or writing data.

For `intersectsWith`, we really don't know anything about the values we'll
receive. It could be a first-party parameter descriptor, or a different third
party descriptor. Internally, we generally choose to treat these as `unknown`,
but since they'll always be descriptors, you could type them as `object` (or
even a slightly more narrow `Descriptor` type).

So, first we need to know if the other descriptor is a resource descriptor. If
it isn't, there's no risk of intersection - or strictly speaking, we will place
the responsibility of determining this intersection on the other descriptor.
Next, we only run the risk of intersection if we're accessing the same data. And
last, we only intersect if either this descriptor or the other is accessing data
mutably. In code:

```ts
class ResourceDescriptor {
	intersectsWith(other: unknown) {
		if (!(other instanceof ResourceDescriptor)) {
			// No intersection if it's not a resource.
			return false;
		}
		if (this.resource !== other.resource) {
			// Also no intersection if we're not accessing the same resource.
			return false;
		}
		if (!this.canWrite && !other.canWrite) {
			// No intersection if neither needs to write data!
			return false;
		}
		// One of us writes data the other needs to read/write.
		// That's an intersection!
		return true;
	}
}
```

Remember that `intersectsWith` does not need to be symmetric. _Both descriptors_
will call this method with the other, and if _either_ returns true, then the
parameters intersect. For example, the `WorldDescriptor` implements this method
like so:

```ts
class WorldDescriptor {
	intersectsWith(other: unknown) {
		return true;
	}
}
```

Because we trust that `WorldDescriptor` correctly implements its own
`intersectsWith` method (it always intersects), `ResourceDescriptor` doesn't
need to concern itself with how it interacts with `WorldDescriptor` or any other
descriptor.

### Turning Parameters Into Arguments

The last step is turning your parameter descriptor into an argument. For this,
we receive the world as an argument, and will usually return some piece of its
internal state. In the case of resources, it's pretty easy to get that data!

```ts
class ResourceDescriptor {
	intoArgument(world: World) {
		return world.getResource(this.resource);
	}
}
```

And perfect - you now have a fully functioning custom system parameter! Here's
the full code:

```ts
class ResourceDescriptor<T extends Class | Mut<Class>> {
	resource: Class;
	canWrite: boolean;

	constructor(resource: T) {
		const isMut = resource instanceof Mut;
		this.resource = isMut ? resource.value : resource;
		this.canWrite = isMut;
	}

	onAddSystem(builder: WorldBuilder) {
		builder.registerResource(this.resource);
	}

	isLocalToThread() {
		return !isStruct(this.resource);
	}

	intersectsWith(other: unknown) {
		if (!(other instanceof ResourceDescriptor)) {
			return false;
		}
		if (this.resource !== other.resource) {
			return false;
		}
		if (!this.canWrite && !other.canWrite) {
			return false;
		}
		return true;
	}

	intoArgument(
		world: World,
	): T extends Mut<infer X>
		? X
		: Readonly<InstanceType<T extends Class ? T : never>> {
		return world.resources.get(this.resource);
	}
}
```

Next, we'll go into how to let the transformer recognize your parameter.

## Transforming system parameters

The transformer plugin accepts config that allows you to register additional
system parameter types for it to recognize. Using the config, we can tell the
transformer how to handle our custom system parameters.

```ts
type ThyseusPluginConfig = {
	systemParameters: SystemParameterMap;
};
type SystemParameterMap = Record<string, SystemParameterDescriptor>;
type SystemParameterDescriptor = { descriptorName: string; importPath: string };
```

The key in the `SystemParameterMap` refers to the **name** of the type we'd like
the transformer to recognize. The `descriptorName` is the **named import** it
will be imported as. `importPath` is the location to import it from. For system
parameters to work correctly, they must be able to be imported from a
_non-relative_ path; how you handle this is dependent on your bundler and how
you'd like to handle import aliasing.

For the case of `Res`, this looks something like:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import { thyseusPlugin } from '@thyseus/transformer-vite';

export default defineConfig({
	plugins: [
		thyseusPlugin({
			systemParameters: {
				Res: {
					descriptorName: 'ResourceDescriptor',
					importPath: 'thyseus/descriptors',
				},
			},
		}),
	],
});
```

We tell the plugin that we'd like it to recognize types named `Res`, and that it
will need to `import { ResourceDescriptor } from 'thyseus/descriptors';` in
order to use that system parameter. When the transformer sees a system with that
type, it'll generate the necessary code to make your systems work.

```ts
// This input...
function mySystem(res: Res) {}

// ...will be transformed into
import { ResourceDescriptor } from 'thyseus/descriptors';

function mySystem(res: Res) {}
mySystem.parameters = [ResourceDescriptor()];
```

As you may have noticed, `ResourceDescriptor()` is treated like a function call,
_not_ a constructor! If you choose to implement system parameters as a class,
you'll need to provide a function that calls that class's constructor.

You also may be realizing that `Res` as provided by Thyseus is generic - in
fact, it has to be in order to work correctly! When system parameters accept
generics, those are passed as arguments to the parameter descriptor function.

```ts
// Untransformed code
class MyResource {}
function mySystem(res: Res<MyResource>) {}

// Transformed!
import { ResourceDescriptor } from 'thyseus/descriptors';

class MyResource {}

function mySystem(res: Res<MyResource>) {}
mySystem.parameters = [ResourceDescriptor(MyResource)];
```

It is up to you to validate that the types provided to your system parameter and
the arguments provided to your descriptor are correct!
