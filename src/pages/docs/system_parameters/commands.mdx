# Commands

`Commands` can be used to spawn & despawn entities, add components to & remove
components from entities, and clear event queues. Individual commands aren't
processed immediately - instead, each command is added to a queue. The entire
queue of commands is later processed in the `applyCommands` system - the effects
of commands are not observeable until _after_ this system runs.

Let's look at how to use `Commands`!

## Setup

Thyseus is built for a wide variety of use cases and doesn't make assumptions
about how your app should work; as a result, **you must add the `applyCommands`
system yourself**. You can add it to whatever schedule you need (and as many
times as you need with `cloneSystem`).

Starting out, it's usually a good idea to add it to the end of the
`DefaultSchedule`.

```ts
import { World, applyCommands, run } from 'thyseus';

const world = await World.new()
	.addSystems(
		// ... All your systems here
		applyCommands,
	)
	.build();
```

## Spawning Entities

The most common use of commands is spawning entities.

```ts
function spawnEntities(commands: Commands) {
	const entityCommands = commands.spawn();
}
```

The `spawn()` method returns an `EntityCommands` object that can be used to
insert additional commands for that entity - like adding or removing components.

If you need to "reobtain" the `EntityCommands` for an entity, you can use
`get()`:

```ts
function getHandle(commands: Commands, query: Query<Entity>) {
	for (const entity of query) {
		const entityCommands = commands.get(heldEntity);
	}
}
```

## Adding/Removing Components

Commands are also how we add & remove components on entities.

To add components, you can use `add()` and `addType()`. Most components must be
added with `add()`, while tag components must be added with `addType()`. Adding
by type is especially useful for ZSTs!

```ts
import { IsEnemy } from './components';

function spawnEntities(commands: Commands) {
	for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
		commands.spawn().add(new Position(1, 2, 3)).addType(IsEnemy);
	}
}
```

`add()` _copies_ the data for the passed component.

When an entity should no longer possess a component, you can use `remove()`:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```ts
function removePoison(
	commands: Commands,
	curedEvents: EventReader<Cured>
) {
	for (const cured of curedEvents) {
		commands.get(cured.entity).remove(Poisoned);
	}
}
```

## Despawning Entities

When you're done with an entity, you can use the `despawn()` method:

```ts
function despawnEntities(
	entities: Query<Entity, With<IsDead>>,
	commands: Commands,
) {
	for (const entity of entities) {
		commands.despawn(entity);
	}
}
```
