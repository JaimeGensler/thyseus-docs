# Systems

Systems (the **S** of ECS) hold all of the responsibility for transforming your
data. Systems are functions that accept only "system parameters". They may
accept zero, one, or many parameters, or even multiple of the same type of
parameter - so long as it accepts only valid system parameters, it's a system.
You never have to worry about _how_ data gets to your systems - it just does!

Systems are the fundamental way you read and write ECS data, so they have many
different uses. Most often, they are used to query for entities with particular
components, but they can also be used to initialize your world, spawn entities,
draw to canvases, serialize data & write it to the file system, or anything else
you might need them to do.

## Defining a system

Let's define a simple system that just spawns an entity and adds a component to
it:

```ts
import { MySuperCoolComponent } from './somewhere';

export function spawnerSystem(commands: Commands) {
	commands.spawn().addType(MySuperCoolComponent);
}
```

When a world executes this systems, it will be called with that world's
[`Commands`](/docs/systems/commands) object. We can do whatever we need with
commands in this system!

There's only so much we can do with `Commands`, so let's try something a little
more complex:

```ts
import { struct } from 'thyseus';
@struct
class Vec2 {
	@struct.f64 declare x: number;
	@struct.f64 declare y: number;
}
class Position extends Vec2 {}
class Velocity extends Vec2 {}

export function moveSystem(query: Query<[Mut<Position>, Velocity]>) {
	for (const [pos, vel] of query) {
		pos.x += vel.x;
		pos.y += vel.y;
	}
}
```

This system has a bit more going on, so let's pick it apart.

We see that this system accepts one argument - a
[`Query`](/docs/systems/queries). This query looks for entities that have both a
`Position` and a `Velocity` component. If you inspect the types of the `pos` and
`vel` variables, you'll see that `pos` is a `Position` instance, but `vel` is a
_readonly_ instance. **By default, component data in Thyseus is readonly;**
systems that mutate data must specify that they will. We can do that by wrapping
the component in `Mut`.

In the function body, we iterate over the query; or, in other words, we iterate
over every entity that has both the `Position` and `Velocity` components. For
each entity, we add the velocity's `x` and `y` to the position's.

Queries and Commands are just two of the system parameters Thyseus provides out
of the box; your systems can get much more complex, using multiple queries,
accessing resources, reading & writing events, or accessing the world itself.
The next sections will cover all of the system parameters in detail. If you need
system parameters not provided by Thyseus, you can also
[create your own system parameters](/docs/advanced_patterns/custom_system_parameters).

## System Dependencies

By default, Thyseus makes no guarantees about the order in which systems will be
executed - it may change from execution to execution, or when building the same
world again If you'd like to require an explicit order between systems, Thyseus
provides a dependency API.

```ts
import { World } from 'thyseus';
function systemA() {}
function systemB() {}
function systemC() {}
function systemD() {}
function systemE() {}

const myWorld = await World.new()
	.addSystem(systemA.before(systemB))
	.addSystem(systemB.after(systemC))
	.addSystem(systemE.afterAll())
	.addSystem(systemD.beforeAll());
```

Dependencies are cleared immediately after being read by world builders, and so
must be set for every world a system is registered in - this is why it is
recommended to declare dependencies in-line or in the same module a world
registers them in.

**Both explicit (`before`, `after`) and implicit (`beforeAll`, `afterAll`)
dependencies apply only to systems that intersect.** For example, if systems `A`
and `B` are disjoint, then `A before B` will have no effect. Similarly,
`A beforeAll` _will **not**_ guarantee that `A` runs before `B` (but will
guarantee that `A` runs before any other systems that `A` intersects with).

Also note that explicit dependencies take precedence over implicit dependencies.
Given intersecting `A` and `B`, `(B beforeAll), (A before B)` will guarantee
that A runs before B. If no explicit resolution is provided, implicit
dependencies are evaluated _in the order they are passed in_. For example, given
`(A beforeAll), (B beforeAll)`, `A` will be guaranteed to execute before `B`.
Given `(A afterAll), (B afterAll)`, `A` will be guaranteed to execute _after_
`B`.

Lastly, contradictory dependencies - such as `A after A` or
`(A before B), (B before A)` - will cause an error to be thrown when the world
is built.

### Transformer notes

The transformer currently has a couple usage caveats.

It only detects **function declarations** and **function expressions in variable
initialization**. For example:

```ts
// Function declaration
function systemA(/* system parameters */) {}

// Expression in a variable assignment
const systemB = function systemBInner(/* system parameters */) {};

// And of course we wouldn't forget about arrow functions
const systemC = (/* system parameters */) => {};
```

Function expressions that are passed to other functions (e.g., inlining a
function in `addSystems()`) will _not_ be transformed! Remember that systems are
just functions, so you can write them however you like - if it is not one of the
above ways, see below how to handle writing systems without the transformer.

**Type aliases are not permitted**. Due to some technical limitations, we check
the _text_ of types rather than the types themselves, and so type names must be
an exact match; creating type aliases (`type MyQuery = Query<...>`), or
"namespacing" types (`import * as Thyseus from 'thyseus'`) **will not work**.
This will be remedied in a future update.

**Functions with rest parameters will not be transformed**, even if the
parameters are typed as a tuple containing only valid system parameters.

**Types referenced in parameters may not be type-only imports.** The transformer
assumes the actual class is in scope, not just the type, so you'll get a
reference error if you use type-only imports!

Lastly, **systems cannot be generic.** Systems act on specific data, and can't
know what types to be generic over. Of course, you may create generic "base"
functions and create systems that simply call those functions with their
non-generic data.

## Systems without the transformer

If you're using plain Javascript, or are building third-party libraries, or
simply do not wish to use the transformer plugin, then you will need to provide
system parameter information yourself. Thyseus uses this information to
determine what data your systems want from a world, as well as how it's
accessed.

Fortunately, writing systems without the transformer only involves one
additional step - adding a `parameters` property to the system. Let's see what
the above examples would look like without the transformer:

```ts
import { CommandsDescriptor } from 'thyseus/descriptors';

export function spawnerSystem(commands: Commands) {
	commands.spawn().addType(Position).addType(Velocity);
}
spawnerSystem.parameters = [CommandsDescriptor()];

export function moveSystem(query: Query<[Mut<Position>, Velocity]>) {
	for (const [pos, vel] of query) {
		pos.x += vel.x;
		pos.y += vel.y;
	}
}
moveSystem.parameters = [Query([Mut(Position), Velocity])];
```
