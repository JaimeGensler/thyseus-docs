# World

On rare occasions, you may need access to the world itself. For this, you can
type one of your system parameters as the `World`. In general, it is best to
avoid accessing the world itself - most APIs that require direct access to the
world are low-level and difficult to use correctly. Additionally, accessing the
world creates a hard sync point when multithreading - no other system can run
while the world is being accessed.

The most common use case for accessing the world is running a custom schedule:

```ts
import { MySchedule } from './somewhere';

async function mySystem(world: World) {
	const someCondition = true; // Complex logic here
	if (someCondition) {
		await world.runSchedule(MySchedule);
	}
}
```

When you use the world system parameter, **you are guaranteed to always access
the world from the main thread**. World instances constructed in threads do not
have access to all data (e.g., mainthread-only resources) and do not have the
ability to communicate with threads other than the main thread. Most world
methods depend on being called only on the main thread!
