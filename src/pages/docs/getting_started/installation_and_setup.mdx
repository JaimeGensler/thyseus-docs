# Installation & Setup

## Package installation

<Aside type="note">
	**This guide assumes that you are using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as your
	bundler.** Currently, the official Thyseus transformer is only available as
	a Vite plugin. If you'd like support to be added for your bundler of choice,
	please [file a
	ticket](https://github.com/JaimeGensler/thyseus/issues/new/choose)!
</Aside>

To get started with Thyseus, let's install the core library as well as the
transformer plugin for Vite.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'yarn', 'npm']}>
	<Tab>
		```sh copy
		pnpm add thyseus && pnpm add -D @thyseus/transformer-vite
		```
	</Tab>
		<Tab>
		```sh copy
		yarn add thyseus && yarn add -D @thyseus/transformer-vite
		```
	</Tab>
	<Tab>
		```sh copy
		npm i thyseus && npm i -D @thyseus/transformer-vite
		```
	</Tab>
</Tabs>

`thyseus` is the actual core library, and where you'll be importing from for
your project. `@thyseus/transformer-vite` is a plugin for Vite that transforms
your source code, allowing Thyseus to provide a first-class developer
experience. All docs will assume you're using the transformer - if you're not,
you'll need to
[review the systems documentation](/docs/systems#systems-without-the-transformer)

As a data-oriented library, Thyseus is designed around types and how they flow
thru your application; additionally, the transformer requires the use of
Typescript to work correctly.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'yarn', 'npm']}>
	<Tab>
		```sh copy
		pnpm add -D typescript
		```
	</Tab>
		<Tab>
		```sh copy
	yarn add -D typescript
		```
	</Tab>
	<Tab>
		```sh copy
		npm i -D typescript
		```
	</Tab>
</Tabs>

If you don't have experience with Typescript, it's recommended that you
[get familiar with the basics](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html)
before starting with Thyseus.

## Plugin setup

Next, let's add the transformer plugin to your config in order to get it working
correctly:

```ts filename="vite.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import { thyseusPlugin } from '@thyseus/transformer-vite';

export default defineConfig({
	plugins: [thyseusPlugin()],
	// your other config...
});
```

And that's all there is to it! Some third-party libraries for Thyseus may add
configuration to `thyseusPlugin()` - you'll need to consult their documentation
to see how to work with them.

## Typescript setup (optional)

Thyseus provides two way of accessing its types; direct imports from
`'thyseus'`, or a global type injection. The choice of which to use is entirely
up to you, and we do not recommend one approach over the other.

If you'd like to use the global type injection, you can add a `.d.ts` file with
the following:

```ts filename="src/thyseusGlobals.d.ts"
import 'thyseus/types';
```

And if you'd like to handle type imports yourself, any Thyseus types can be
simply imported:

```ts
import type { Query, Res /* ...any types you want */ } from 'thyseus';
```

For the sake of brevity, code snippets in the docs will assume you are using the
global type injection.

## Development vs. production builds

Thyseus uses [`esm-env`](https://github.com/benmccann/esm-env) to determine
whether you're building your app for development or production. Dev builds have
a number of additional correctness checks and validations that help you make
sure your app works correctly and that thrown errors are easily debuggable.
These checks come at the cost of speed, so for production builds these checks
are stripped out. **As long as you're using a modern bundler, this should happen
automatically.**
