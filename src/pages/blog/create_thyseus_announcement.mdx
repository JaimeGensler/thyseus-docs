# Get started with Thyseus faster!

Cheers, and welcome to the Thyseus blog! If you're new here, Thyseus is an
archetypal Entity Component System (ECS) aimed at providing a best-in-class
developer experience with blazing-fast performance. Getting started by checking
out [the docs](/docs/getting_started).

This is no typical release blog - rather, I'm stoked to announce a _new_ package
in the Thyseus ecosystem.

## create-thyseus

`create-thyseus` is a simple CLI package should hopefully make it much easier to
get started with Thyseus quickly by handling scaffolding projects for you.

Using it is simple, and doesn't require memorizing any special flags. Just run:

```sh
pnpm create thyseus@latest
```

It'll ask you a few questions before creating a new project for you, complete
with typical Vite configuration, setting up the Thyseus plugin, and an extremely
basic app outline. All you need to do is `cd` into your project and run
`pnpm i && pnpm dev` !

This tool will likely be extended with more options in the future, especially as
the Thyseus ecosystem grows.

Enjoy, and until next time!
