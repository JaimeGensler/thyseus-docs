# Advanced Patterns

This section contains details on advanced patterns. Other sections try to assume
little to moderate knowledge of Javascript and build on each other to create a
thorough understanding of how to use Thyseus; pages in this section will assume
a fairly strong knoweldge of Javascript, some basic familiarity with lower-level
concepts, and a deeper understanding of Thyseus. Most concepts in this section
will also be of limited use - you will rarely need to reach for most of these
tools, and some of them you may never need!
