# Worlds

Worlds contain your entities and components, and are responsible for executing
systems. Every world is independent and self-contained; systems and types can be
used by multiple worlds, but data belongs to a single world.

## Adding Systems

Worlds can be constructed with `new World(config)`. They may add components,
events, and even systems at any point.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```ts
import { World, Schedule } from 'thyseus';
import { Inventory, IsPlayer } from './components';

const world = await new World()
	.addSystems(Schedule, inventorySystem)
	.prepare();
```

The `addSystems()` method return the `World` itself so it can be chained. Let's
add a few more systems!

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```ts {5}
import { World, Schedule } from 'thyseus';
import { move, draw, handleInput } from './systems';

const myWorldBuilder = await World.new()
	.addSystems(Schedule, [move, draw, handleInput])
	.prepare();
```

You'll notice we're calling `.prepare()` here - after adding all the systems
you'd like to get started, you need to _prepare_ the world to run. Some systems
require some async setup, so this will return a promise. Any time you add new
systems to the world, you'll need to `prepare()` it again.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```ts {9}
import { World } from 'thyseus';

function helloSystem() {
	console.log('Hello, world!')
}

const myWorld = await new World()
	.addSystems(helloSystem)
	.prepare();
```

<Callout type="note">
	Top-level await is a convenient way to handle the promise returned by
	`prepare()`, but is not required.
</Callout>

Let's also setup a loop to run your world!

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```ts {11-15}
import { World, Schedule } from 'thyseus';

function helloSystem() {
	console.log('Hello, world!')
}

function setup(world: World) {
	async function loop(timeElapsed: number) {
		world.runSchedule(Schedule);
		requestAnimationFrame(loop);
	}
	loop(0);
}

const myWorld = await new World()
	.addSystems(helloSystem)
	.prepare();

const world = await new World()
	.addSystems(helloSystem)
	.addEventListener('start', setup)
	.prepare();

world.start();

```

Here, we're adding an event listener to the world's `"start"` event. When
`start` is emitted, we're establishing a loop that runs the default schedule
(all systems added with `addSystems()`) once per frame.

If you look in your browser's log, you should see a whole lot of
`"Hello, world!"`s!

## Schedules

Worlds can contain multiple groups of systems called **Schedules**. Schedules
have a number of different uses - creating groups of systems that only runs when
your app starts, or when tearing down, or systems that need to run at a fixed
rate like physics systems.

Thyseus provides the `Schedule` class which stores systems and their arguments
and handles running them. You can create your own schedules by extending this
class - e.g. `class PhysicsSchedule extends Schedule {}`. When calling
`addSystems()`, you _must_ specify a schedule to add systems to.

## Plugins

Plugins are simply functions that accept a `World` and register systems and
types on that `World`. Plugins give you the flexibility to change the
implementation details of a piece of functionality without changing the external
API.

```ts
import { World, Schedule } from 'thyseus';
import {
	applyForces,
	detectCollisions,
	resolveCollisions,
} from './physicsSystems';

class FixedUpdateSchedule extends Schedule {}

function physicsPlugin(world: World) {
	world.addSystems(FixedUpdateSchedule, [
		applyForces,
		detectCollisions,
		resolveCollisions,
	]);
}

const world = await World.new().addPlugin(physicsPlugin).build();
```
