# Thyseus v0.18 - Some QOL Wins

Keeping it brief this time, this update focuses on some minor quality of life
changes - specifically, replacing `Commands`/`EntityCommands`/`applyCommands`
and adding a sensible default for when entities are updated (which can still be
customized). Overall, migrating to this version should be fairly straightforward
and painless, and Thyseus's bundle size has dropped by another 15-20%.

The primary motivation for this change is reducing indirection - you already
needed `Entity` objects to work with `Commands` anyway, so we opted to make the
APIs a little more direct. Note that **changes to an entity's components are
still enqueued** and you can add the new `applyEntityUpdates` system to have
these changes processed.

## ðŸ’¥ Breaking Changes

-   Removed `Commands`
-   Removed `EntityCommands`
-   Removed `applyCommands`
-   Removed `Entity.p.index`, `Entity.p.generation`; `Entity.p.id` changed from
    `bigint` to `number`
    -   Entities no longer use generational indexes, preferring a simple
        auto-incrementing integer
    -   It's possible generational indexes will make a comeback in the future,
        but `id` should stay a number
-   Removed `Entity.p.is()`
    -   You can compare `Entity` objects with normal `===` as each object is
        unique, or with `entity.id` if you prefer.
-   Removed `EventReader.p.clear()`, `EventWriter.p.clearImmediate()`
-   `EventWriter.p.clear()` now immediately clears the queue.
-   Renamed `SystemRes<T>` to `Local<T>`
    -   This is a much more intuitive name. It also matches Bevy!
-   Modified `Entities` methods
    -   As a reminder, until 1.0 `Entities` should more-or-less be considered an
        implementation detail and will not necessarily have a stable API; use
        with caution.

## âœ¨ Features

-   Added `World.p.spawn()`
    -   Returns a new `Entity` with a unique id; should work as a drop-in
        replacement for `Commands.p.spawn()`
-   Added `Entity.p.add()` `Entity.p.addType()`, `Entity.p.remove()` and
    `Entity.p.despawn()` methods
    -   These function identically as their prior `EntityCommands` counterparts
-   Added `Entity.p.has()`
    -   Pass a component class to see if an entity has that component or not
    -   Sorry this one took so long to make it back in!
-   Added `applyEntityUpdates` system
    -   Entity spawning, despawning, and component add/remove is handled here,
        so this is generally a drop-in replacement for `applyCommands`
-   Added `entityUpdateTiming: 'before' | 'after' | 'custom'` to World config
    -   `'before'` means entities are updated before systems are executed by
        `World.p.runSchedule()`
    -   `'after'` means entities are updated _after_ systems have executed with
        `World.p.runScheudle()
    -   `'custom'` means entities will not update by default; they can be
        updated with `applyEntityUpdates` in this case
    -   Defaults to `'after'`
-   Added `clearAllEventQueues` system
    -   This is a simple utility system that works as the name implies. If
        you're typically calling `clear()` every time you read events, just add
        this to the schedule instead
-   Classes used with `Res<T>` and `Local<T>` are no longer required to have a
    static `fromWorld()` property
    -   In case of its absence, the constructor will be called with no arguments
-   Filters that aren't used should now by tree-shakeable
    -   Individual filters are _really_ small so this isn't a meaningful gain,
        but it sure is neat!

## What's Next?

Development has slowed down quite a bit, mainly because I'm spending more time
_using_ Thyseus now that it's in solid shape and feels intuitive to work with.
This new perspective of library consumer rather than maintainer is largely
responsible for these QOL improvements.

All that said, the long and short term goals of the library have not changed, I
am still maintaining Thyseus and will continue to do so, and bug reports &
feature requests are still very welcome and will be addressed.

Cheers, and until next time!
