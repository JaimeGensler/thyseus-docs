# v0.16 Released

In the last blog post I mentioned that there were no particularly large plans
for the near future - so naturally, within a week I was rethinking Thyseus's
fundamental architecture. I spent some time working out the weakpoints as well
as what causes them, challening many of the assumptions we've made along the
way. The internal design has changed so much that this update is essentially
Thyseus 2.0. Fortunately, upgrading to 0.16 should mostly involve deleting code
and some small tweaks to areas with low surface area, like schedule definition.

This release has a _ton_ of cross-cutting concerns and miscellaneous updates. To
make it an easier read, we'll first dive in to the internal changes and
motivations before moving to a simple changelog. Feel free to skip straight to
the changelog if you want to get going right away!

## Weakpoints & Internal Changes

Thyseus has a lot of strong points - overall, working with the library is fairly
straightforward, and the way we model concepts like components and systems feels
like the "correct" foundation. However, there's many areas where Thyseus doesn't
behave predictably, where we break away from assumptions you can normally make
when working with Javascript. Given how web is more and more targetable with
WASM these days, the selling point of a Javascript ECS is the language itself!

So - the main "theme" of this update is **working _with_ Javascript, not against
it**. Fighting against the language - or trying to outsmart the VM - is a losing
battle, and has shown up in performance, library DX, and internal productivity.
It's not too bad in one of these area, but we have issues in all of these as a
that makes maintenance and use of Thyseus more painful than necessary.

So what exactly is wrong?

-   Multithreading is inflexible and slow (explored in depth later).
-   The amount of code shipped with all consumers of Thyseus is considerable,
    while much of it benefits only a subset of users.
-   Handling components and resources can be counterintuitive.
    -   Early `return` in systems and `continue`/`break` in queries doesn't
        always work.
    -   Async patterns are tricky.
    -   Callbacks don't refer to what they appear to.
-   Internal development iteration is slow.
    -   Adding/modifying tests is difficult.
    -   There are too many cross-dependencies, making isolating breaking changes
        or new features difficult.
-   Integration with third-party libraries is difficult-to-impossible.
-   Reaching into the core library is impractical unless you read and understand
    the entire source code.
-   Extending worlds at runtime (adding/removing systems, runtime components,
    etc.) is highly desireable but not possible.

But what's causing all of this? Teasing it apart, the primary issue is
parallelism (i.e., the heuristics and APIs it requires), object pooling, and
memory control.

### Threads

For some time now, I've felt Thyseus has failed to deliver on one of it's big
selling points - multithreading. While a half-measure solution is in place, it
has historically been buggy, inflexible, and slow. Writing a sound & performant
smart scheduler is hard, but more to the point it's become apparent that it's
not even what most people want from a threading solution. The far more common
use cases are a dedicated render or physics thread, or a way to free the main
thread of some non-essential tasks.

With this in mind, I've considered what a solution that meets real needs might
look like. This new solution would never have been possible without invaluable
input from [3mcd](https://github.com/3mcd)!

For its first release, the new API is arguably less featured than the previous
API; it's much more explicit, and requires you to get hands-on with threads,
synchronization, and data sharing. However, it's also significantly more atomic,
flexible, and extensible while remaining **as safe as the previous solution**.
As a bonus, it's much lighter weight and can even be tree-shaken for those not
using threads. The details of how to use the new API are included in the
changelog.

### Object Pooling & Memory Control

The other issues at the core of Thyseus are largely a result of object pooling
and backing data with binary types - things we've relied on since the first
release. The theory was binary types could allow runtimes to generate more
optimal bytecode, and object reuse would keep memory usage lower and potentially
be more cache-friendly.

This forgets that Javascript runtimes are really, _really_ good at what they do;
so good, in fact, that in testing I've consistently seen that it's actually
faster to just iterate a list of objects. If you keep your object shapes stable
and Thyseus handles densely packing data in single-type arrays, JIT compilers
will do the difficult work for us. It's tough to give measurements on the exact
gains as they vary quite a bit by runtime and object shape, but overall this
change should be as fast as previous versions and usually faster.

### Conclusion

Putting all of these changes together, we were able to fully remove the `Memory`
API, `@struct`, binary types, and any memory management. Components, events, and
resources are just class instances now - any class you'd like - and callbacks
and promises can reliably refer to component instances.

Ahead-of-time type registration was only a requirement for the previous
iteration of multithreading to work. With the API changed, `WorldBuilder` can be
removed and components, resources, events, and systems can all be added at
runtime. Similarly, system dependencies and immutable default were only needed
for smart scheduling, and so those APIs have been removed as well. All in all,
the PR for this release saw a net reduction of around 5,500 lines of code!

All these changes mean **Thyseus has shrunk by around 40%**. Even better, many
more parts of the library are now tree-shakeable and the transformer has far
fewer responsibilities, only handling system transformation at the moment.

At this point, working with Thyseus should have no surprises or caveats - write
Javascript that behaves exactly like you'd think it would and let us hold on to
your data for you.

### What's Next?

While the changes here weren't the original plan for 0.16, this update has
solidified the core architecture and unlocked a lot of potential for Thyseus.
It's also incorporated all of the breaking changes I think are likely for the
future. I've put together a
[1.0 roadmap](https://github.com/users/JaimeGensler/projects/3) detailing the
remaining features Thyseus should have for a 1.0 release. The list may grow or
shrink and more breaking updates before 1.0 are possible, but at the moment
these are the planned updates for the forseeable future. As always, feel free to
request any new features or fixes on
[Github](https://github.com/JaimeGensler/thyseus/issues) or in the `#thyseus`
channel of the [Web ECS Discord](https://discord.gg/T3g8U89qqZ)

Cheers, and until next time!

## Changelog

### Breaking Changes

-   Removed `World.new()` and `WorldBuilder`
    -   Worlds can be constructed with `new World(config)`.
    -   Added `World.p.addSystems()`, which accepts **two arguments** - a
        schedule and a system or _array_ of systems.
    -   An `addSystemsToSchedule()` method no longer exists.
    -   Added `World.p.addPlugin()`
        -   Plugins should accept a `World` rather than a `WorldBuilder`.
    -   Call `World.p.prepare(): Promise<World>` before `World.p.start()` to
        prepare systems to be run.
    -   Components, events, resources, and systems can all be added at runtime.
-   All previous fields of world config removed.
    -   See features for new fields.
-   `Memory` removed.
-   `@struct` removed.
    -   Decorator and transformer emit removed. Components, resources and events
        still must be class instances.
-   **Data is not copied** when adding components or events - objects _are_ data
    and are treated uniquely.
-   Sized components must be added with `.add()`, and cannot be added with
    `.addType()`.
-   Binary types (e.g. `u8`, `u16`, etc.) removed.
    -   Use `number` instead.
-   `DefaultSchedule` and `StartSchedule` removed; schedules are no longer
    symbols.
    -   Schedules can be created by using and/or extending the new `Schedule`
        class (e.g. `class PhysicsSchedule extends Schedule {}`).
    -   See features for `StartSchedule` replacement.
-   `Mut<T>` removed.
    -   Mutability is the new default.
    -   Wrapping queried components/resources in `Readonly<T>` is permitted.
-   `run()` function removed.
    -   Systems will execute in the order they are added (this is identical to
        past behavior if you were only using single-threaded execution).
-   Worlds no longer use resource constructors.
    -   Resources must either define a `static fromWorld()` property or be
        inserted directly with `World.p.insertResource()`.
-   System parameter descriptors removed.
    -   System parameters use a new static `intoArgument()` method.
-   `system.parameters` removed.
    -   Systems use a new `system.getSystemArguments()` property.
    -   Transformer emit has been updated so no changes are required here.
-   Global type injection import removed.

### Features

-   Any class, with any type of data contained within, can be used as a
    component, resource, or event!
    -   Constructors may have required arguments.
    -   Tag components (ZSTs) can be created by extending the exported `Tag`
        class, and must be added with `Commands.p.addType()`.
    -   `Promise.p.then()` and other callbacks will refer to the data/objects
        you think they will.
    -   Components/events/resources must still be class instances
-   World Event Listeners!
    -   Worlds are now event emitters. You can subscribe to events with
        `World.p.addEventListener()` and unsubscribe with
        `World.p.removeEventListener()`.
    -   Current events are:
        -   `"start"`, emitted when `World.p.start()` is called.
        -   `"stop"`, emitted when `World.p.stop()` is called.
        -   `"createTable"`, emitted when new tables are created.
-   New Threads API!
    -   In a thread module, define functions that can be called from the main
        thread with `expose()`. e.g.
        ```ts filename="myThreadModule.ts"
        export default expose({
        	add(left: number, right: number) {
        		return left + right;
        	},
        });
        ```
    -   Access threads in systems with the `Thread<T>` system parameter
        ```ts filename="mainThreadModule.ts"
        export function mySystem(
        	thread: Thread<typeof import('./myThreadModule.ts')>,
        ) {
        	const result = await thread.call('add', 2, 2);
        	console.log(result); // 4
        }
        ```
    -   Use `call()` as many times as needed, and handle the promises however
        you'd like!
    -   [Documentation for threads](/docs/system_parameters/threads)
-   New `Read<T>` type!
    -   When `Readonly<T>` isn't strict enough, you can use `Read<T>`, which
        enforces deep immutability and removes mutating methods (methods that
        don't have their `this` type as `Read<T>`).
-   Custom commands!
    -   Create your own command queue class and defer certain effects till the
        `applyCommands` system.
    -   More documentation to be added in the future.
-   New world config options!
    -   `createWorker(scriptURL: string): WorkerLike` - use to define a custom
        worker creator. Defaults to a browser-oriented version.
    -   World config may have custom fields if needed.
-   Most first-party classes are exported.
-   Significantly expanded & improved inline documentation.
