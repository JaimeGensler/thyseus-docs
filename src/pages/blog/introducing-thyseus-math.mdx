# Introducing `@thyseus/math`

Recently I've taken interest in rendering - specifically, handwriting WebGPU
renderers. I've worked on a number of different toys, and have consistently
found myself copying around a set of math primitives (`Vec3`, `Mat4`, and the
likes). [`gl-matrix`](https://github.com/toji/gl-matrix) is a fantastic and
well-maintained library, but Thyseus requires you to work with class instances,
which poses a bit of a problem here.

I've taken the time to class-ify some of the types I've needed the most,
re-implementing them internally to remove a dependency and delete a little code
here and there that isn't used for these implementations. This is essentially a
re-implementation/redistribution of the work done by the `gl-matrix` folks - all
credit really goes to [Toji](https://github.com/toji) and the maintainers.

As this page and the annotations will have to serve as documentation for the
time being, the library provides:

-   Classes
    -   `Mat4`
    -   `Quat`
    -   `Vec2`
    -   `Vec3`
    -   `Vec4`
-   Functions
    -   `clamp(min: number, value: number, max: number): number`
    -   `degreesToRadians(degrees: number): number`
    -   `radiansToDegrees(radians: number): number`
-   Constants
    -   `HALF_PI`
    -   `PI`
    -   `TAU`
    -   `ORIGIN`
    -   `EPSILON`
    -   `NORTH` / `SOUTH` / `EAST` / `WEST` / `UP` / `DOWN`

Additionally, these were built with a few guiding principles in mind:

-   `this` is mutable; arguments are immutable.
    -   Methods never mutate passed arguments, only `this`
-   No hidden object creation.
    -   Methods other than `clone()` never create objects
-   Fully tree-shakeable
    -   While some methods assume certain types as arguments, there are no
        internal dependencies so you only pay for what you use

Hopefully this helps some other people wanting to use gl-matrix with Thyseus! If
you find yourself needing any classes or methods not provided now, feel free to
open a feature request.

Cheers, and until next time!
