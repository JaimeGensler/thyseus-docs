# v0.16 Released

In the last blog post I mentioned that there were no particularly large plans
for the near future - so naturally, within a week I was rethinking Thyseus's
fundamental architecture. I spent some time working out the weakpoints as well
as what causes them, challening many of the assumptions we've made along the
way. The internal design has changed so much that this update is essentially
Thyseus 2.0 (although fortunately, the migration shouldn't be too painful).

This release blog has a _ton_ of internal cross-cutting concerns and
miscellaneous updates. To make it a sane read, I'm going to first focus on the
internal changes before moving to a migration guide. Feel free to skip straight
to migration if you want to get going right away!

## Weakpoints & Internal Changes

The main theme of this update is **work _with_ Javascript, not against it**.
Fighting against the language - or trying to outsmart the VM - is a losing
battle, and will show up either in performance, library DX, internal
productivity, or all of the above. In other words - if I'm going to make a
Javscript ECS, I want to make a _Javascript_ ECS.

So what's wrong with Thyseus today?

-   Multithreading is inflexible and slow (explored in depth later).
-   The amount of code shipped with all consumers of Thyseus is considerable,
    while much of it benefits only a subset of users.
-   Async patterns within systems are really tricky.
-   Handling components and resources is sometimes counterintuitive.
-   Development iteration is slow.
    -   Adding/modifying tests is difficult.
    -   There are too many cross-dependencies, making isolating breaking changes
        and even new features difficult.
-   Integration with third-party libraries is difficult-to-impossible.
-   Reaching into the core library is impractical unless you read and understand
    the entire source code of the library.
-   Extending worlds at runtime (adding/removing systems, runtime components,
    etc.) is highly desireable but not possible.

But what's causing all of this? Teasing it apart, the primary issue is the
multithreading API (i.e., the heuristics and APIs it requires), object pooling,
and memory control.

### Threads

For some time now, I've felt Thyseus fails to deliver on one of it's big selling
points - multithreading. While a half-measure solution is in place, it has
historically been buggy, inflexible, and slow. Writing a sound & performant
smart scheduler is hard, but more to the point it's become apparent that it's
not even what most people want from a threading solution. The far more common
use cases are a dedicated render or physics thread, or a way to free the main
thread of some non-essential tasks.

With this in mind, I've considered what a solution that would meet real needs
would look like. This new solution would never have been possible without
invaluable input from [mcd](https://github.com/3mcd)!

The new API is arguably less featured than the previous API - it's much more
explicit, and requires you to get hands-on with threads, synchronization, and
data sharing. However, it's also significantly more atomic and flexible whiel
remaining **as safe** as the previous solution. As a bonus, it's much lighter
weight and can even be tree-shaken for those not using threads. The details of
how to use the new API are included in the changelog.

### Object Pooling & Memory Control

The other main issues at the core of Thyseus are largely a result of object
pooling and backing data with binary types - things we've relied on since the
first release. The theory was binary types could allow runtimes to generate more
optimal bytecode, and object reuse would keep memory usage lower and potentially
be more cache-friendly.

This forgets that Javascript runtimes are really, _really_ good at what they do;
so good, in fact, that it's actually faster to just iterate a list of objects
than to re-use an object and move different different data into & out of it. If
you keep your object shapes stable and Thyseus handles densely packing data in
single-type arrays, JIT compilers will handle the difficult work for us. It's
tough to give exact measurements on this as the exact gains vary quite a bit by
runtime and object shape, but overall this change should be as fast as previous
versions, and usually faster.

This paired with the multithreading changes meant we were able to fully remove
the `Memory` API, `@struct`, binary types, and any memory management.
Components, events, and resources are just class instances now - **any** class
you'd like - and callbacks and promises can reliably refer to component
instances. There's also no benefit of register types ahead of time, so
`WorldBuilder` is no longer needed and components, resources, events, and
systems can all be added at runtime.

All these changes mean **Thyseus has shrunk by around 40%**. Even better, many
more parts of the library are now tree-shakeable and the transformer has far
fewer responsibilities; the transformer is no longer a requirement of using
Thyseus, and is merely a DX improvement.

At this point, working with Thyseus should have no surprises or caveats - write
Javascript that behaves exactly like you'd think it would and let us hold on to
your data for you.

## Changelog

### Breaking Changes

-   Removed `World.new()` and `WorldBuilder`
    -   Worlds can be constructed with `new World(config)`
    -   Worlds can add plugins and systems with the APIs you're used to.
    -   Call `world.prepare()` before `world.start()` to prepare systems to be
        run.
    -   Components, events, resources, and systems can all be added at runtime
        if needed.
-   All previous fields of world config removed.
    -   See features for new fields.
-   `Memory` removed.
-   `@struct` removed.
    -   Decorator and transformer emit removed. Components, resources and events
        must be class instances.
    -   Components must be added to entities with `.add()` and not `.addType()`.
    -   **Data is not copied** when adding components or events - objects _are_
        the data and are treated uniquely.
-   Binary types (e.g. `u8`, `u16`, etc.) removed.
    -   Use `number` instead.
-   `DefaultSchedule` and `StartSchedule` removed; schedules are no longer
    symbols.
    -   Custom schedules can be created by extending the new `Schedule` class
        (e.g. `class PhysicsSchedule extends Schedule {}`)
    -   `DefaultSchedule` replaced with the `Schedule` class; see features for
        `StartSchedule` replacement.
-   `Mut<T>` removed.
    -   Mutability is the new default.
    -   Wrapping queried components/resources in `Readonly<T>` is permitted.
-   `run()` removed.
    -   Systems will execute in the order they are added (this is identical to
        past behavior if you were only using single-threaded execution).
-   System parameter descriptors removed.
    -   System parameters use a new static `intoArgument()` method.
-   `System.parameters` removed.
    -   Systems use a new `system.getSystemArguments()` property.
-   Global type injection import removed.

### Features

-   Any class, with any type of data contained within, can be used as a
    component, resource, or event!
    -   Constructors may have required arguments.
    -   Components must be added to entities with `.add()` and not `.addType()`.
    -   Tag components (ZSTs) can be created by extending the exported `Tag`
        class, and must be added with `.addType()`.
    -   `Promise.then()` and other callbacks will refer to the data/objects you
        think they will.
    -   Components/events/resources must still be class instances
-   World Event Listeners!
    -   Worlds are now event emitters. You can subscribe to events with
        `addEventListener()` and unsubscribe with `removeEventListener()`.
    -   Current events are:
        -   `"start"`, emitted when `world.start()` is called.
        -   `"stop"`, emitted when `world.stop()` is called.
        -   `"createTable"`, emitted when new tables are created.
-   New Threads API!
    -   In a thread module, define functions that can be called with the main
        thread with `expose()`. e.g.
        ```ts filename="myThreadModule.ts"
        export default expose({
        	add(left: number, right: number) {
        		return left + right;
        	},
        });
        ```
    -   Access threads in systems with the `Thread<T>` system parameter
        ```ts filename="mainThreadModule.ts"
        export function mySystem(
        	thread: Thread<typeof import('./myThreadModule.ts')>,
        ) {
        	const result = await thread.run('add', 2, 2);
        	console.log(result); // 4
        }
        ```
    -   Call `run()` as many times as needed, and handle the promises however
        you'd like!
    -   [Documentation for threads]()
-   New `Read<T>` type!
    -   When `Readonly<T>` isn't strict enough, you can use `Read<T>`, which
        enforces deep mutability and removes mutating methods (methods that
        don't have their `this` type as `Read<T>`).
-   Custom commands!
    -   Create your own command queue class and defer certain effects till the
        `applyCommands` system.
    -   [Documentation for custom command queues]().
-   New world config options!
    -   `createWorker(scriptURL: string): WorkerLike` - use to define a custom
        worker creator. Defaults to a browser-oriented version.
    -   World config may have custom fields if needed.
-   Most first-party classes are exported.
-   Significantly expanded & improved inline documentation.
