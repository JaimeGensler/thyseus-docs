# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Thyseus docs! Please review
this document and the [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before submitting
any pull requests.

## Pull Requests

_**Corrections and issues requesting clarification are welcome at any point;
please - ask first before starting new pages/sections.**_ As Thyseus is
currently pre-1.0 release, there are sometimes changes that make old docs
innacurate, and the last thing I want is for you to spend time helping, just for
it to no longer be relevent with a new release! If you'd like to contribute new
docs sections/pages, feel free to ping me or create an issue and I'll respond as
soon as I'm able to.

## General Guidelines

-   PRs should be formatted using prettier - config is included in the project
    root.
