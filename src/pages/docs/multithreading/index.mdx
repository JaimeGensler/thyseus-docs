# Multithreading

Just as with any other Javascript, your code runs on a single thread by default
However, Thyseus is designed to allow you to take advantage of running your code
on multiple threads with a simple change of configuration. You don't need to
worry about scheduling, locks, creating and communicating between workers, or
how to share/propogate data - all of this is handled internally!

Thyseus also provides a number of safety guarantees. It takes advantage of
technologies offered by modern browsers to enable parallelism; **it does not and
will never use unsafe code**, such as stringifying functions, using `eval` or
eval-like constructs, creating workers from blobs, or any other type of run-time
code generation. You can rest assured that your Thyseus projects are exactly as
safe as the code _you_ write, and changing between single/multithreading does
not make a difference.

## Compatability with other multithreading solutions

Thyseus' multithreading solution is not designed to be compatible with other
multithreading solutions. While this is an area we'd like to explore in the
future, for now there are a couple workarounds.

If you would like to use a different multithreading model altogether, you can
still specify that you want Thyseus to use a `SharedArrayBuffer` for your data
in your world configuration:

```ts
import { World } from 'thyseus';

// Thyseus will not construct its own threads, but it will use SharedArrayBuffer
const myWorld = World.new({ threads: 1, useSharedMemory: true });
```

Alternatively, if the functionality of other libraries can be expressed as
Thyseus systems, they should be able to reap the benefits of multithreading as
well.
