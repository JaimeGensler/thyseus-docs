# System Resources

System Resources are a variation of resources that are unique _per system_,
rather than per world. This means that multiple system resources of the same
type can exist in the world. System resources are always considered mutable, as
they are owned by a single system. A system may also have multiple of the same
type of system resource, each containing different values:

```ts
import { struct } from 'thyseus';

@struct
class A {
	value: u32 = 0;
}

function mySystem(a1: Res<A>, a2: Res<A>) {
	console.log(a1 === a2); // -> true
}
function mySystem(a1: SystemRes<A>, a2: SystemRes<A>) {
	console.log(a1 === a2); // -> false
}
```

Like world resources, system resources are considered accessible from any thread
if decorated by `@struct` and bound to the main thread otherwise. `@struct`
system resources will have consistent values across threads, making them a good
replacement for mutable local closures.

System resources are scoped to the system that uses them; if a system exists in
multiple schedules, it will _always_ receive the same system resource! If your
system needs to receive different objects in different schedules, you can
_clone_ that system and use the clone in one of the schedules.

Apart from their scope, system resources function identically to normal
resources, `initialize` and all. In fact, the same class could be used both as a
system resource and as a world resource!
