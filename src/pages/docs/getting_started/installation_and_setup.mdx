# Installation & Setup

## Package installation

<Callout type="note">
	**This guide assumes that you are using a [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/)-
	or [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)-based bundler.** The official Thyseus
	transformer is available as a (Vite-compatible) Rollup plugin and a webpack
	plugin. If you'd like support to be added for your bundler of choice, please
	[file a ticket](https://github.com/JaimeGensler/thyseus/issues/new/choose)!
</Callout>

To get started with Thyseus, let's install the core library:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'yarn', 'npm']}>
	<Tab>
		```sh
		pnpm add thyseus
		```
	</Tab>
		<Tab>
		```sh
		yarn add thyseus
		```
	</Tab>
	<Tab>
		```sh
		npm i thyseus
		```
	</Tab>
</Tabs>

Sweet! Next, let's get the Thyseus transformer. The transformer transpiles your
code to make it more performant and to provide better DX. All docs will assume
you're using the transformer - if you're not, you'll need to
[review the systems docs](/docs/core_concepts/systems#systems-without-the-transformer).

The transformer also depends on the use of Typescript; if you don't have
experience with Typescript, it's recommended that you
[get familiar with the basics](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html)
before starting with Thyseus.

```sh
pnpm add typescript @thyseus/transformer-rollup
```

## Plugin setup

Next, let's add the transformer plugin to your config in order to get it working
correctly:

```ts filename="vite.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import { thyseusPlugin } from '@thyseus/transformer-vite';

export default defineConfig({
	plugins: [thyseusPlugin()],
	// your other config...
});
```

And that's all there is to it!

## Typescript setup (optional)

As Thyseus is a data-oriented library, you'll be making heavy use of its types.
Thyseus provides two way of accessing types - direct imports from `'thyseus'`,
or a global type injection. The choice of which to use is entirely up to you!

If you'd like to use global type injection, you can add a `.d.ts` file with the
following:

```ts filename="src/thyseusGlobals.d.ts"
import 'thyseus/types';
```

If you'd rather not, types can simply be imported:

```ts
import type { Query, Res /* ...any types you want */ } from 'thyseus';
```

For the sake of brevity, code snippets in the docs will assume you are using the
global type injection.

## Development vs. production builds

Thyseus uses [`esm-env`](https://github.com/benmccann/esm-env) to determine
whether you're building your app for development or production. Dev builds have
a number of additional correctness checks and validations that help you make
sure your app works correctly and that thrown errors are easily debuggable.
These checks come at the cost of speed, so for production builds these checks
are stripped out. **As long as you're using a modern bundler, this should happen
automatically.**
