# System Resources

System Resources are a variation of resources that are unique _per system_,
rather than per world. This means that multiple system resources of the same
type can exist in the world. System resources are always considered mutable, as
they are owned by a single system. A system may also have multiple of the same
type of system resource, each containing different values:

```ts
import { struct } from 'thyseus';

@struct
class A {
	@struct.u32 declare value: number;
}

function mySystem(a1: Res<A>, a2: Res<A>) {
	console.log(a1 === a2); // -> true
}
function mySystem(a1: SystemRes<A>, a2: SystemRes<A>) {
	console.log(a1 === a2); // -> false
}
```

If using multithreading, system resources - like normal resources - will be
considered callable from any thread if decorated by `@struct`, and will be bound
to the main thread otherwise. For structs, their values will be consistent
across threads, making them a good replacement for mutable local closures, if
necessary.

System resources are scoped to the system that uses them; if a system exists in
multiple schedules, or multiple times in the same schedule, it will _always_
receive the same system resource! If your would like your system to receive
different system resources, you'll want to use the exported `cloneSystem`
function.

Apart from their scope, system resources function identically to normal
resources, `initialize` and all. In fact, the same class could be used both as a
system resource and as a world resource!
