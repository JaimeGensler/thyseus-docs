# Resources

Resources are world-unique data that exist for the entire lifetime of the world.
This means that, unlike components, they are not tied to a specific entity.
Resources are the ideal way to handle things like time (frame number, delta,
etc.), renderers, inputs, and other data that is unique to a world.

## Defining resources

Like components, resources are classes. Unlike components, they _can_ be, but
are not required to be, decorated with `@struct`. Resources decorated with
`@struct` will be accessible from any thread, while resources that are not will
only be accessible on the main thread.

```ts
import { struct } from 'thyseus';

// Systems using this resource could be called from any thread
@struct
class Time {
	@struct.f64 declare previous: number;
	@struct.f64 declare current: number;
	@struct.f64 declare delta: number;
	@struct.u32 declare frameNumber: number;
}

// Systems using this resource will only be called from the main thread
class Renderer {
	draw() {
		// ...
	}
}
```

When these resources are used by systems, they will be refering to the same
object (or, the same data for structs in worker threads):

```ts
class MyResource {}

function aSystem(myResource: Res<MyResource>) {
	// myResource here...
}
function anotherSystem(myResource: Res<MyResource>) {
	// ... is the same object as myResource here!
}
```

**Like component data, resources are readonly by default.**. If you'd like to
mutate a resource, you can simply wrap it in `Mut<>`:

```ts
class MyResource {}

function someSystem(myResource: Res<Mut<MyResource>>) {
	// myResource can be mutated now!
}
```

<Aside type="tip">
	As mentioned, resources are _world-unique_ - only one instance of a class
	will be constructed per world. If you have a type that you'd like to use as
	multiple resources, you can simply subclass it.
</Aside>

## Initializing resources

In some cases, you may want to access your resource from any thread, but it must
run some initialization on the main thread. For these cases, we can implement a
special `initialize` method that will be called when the world is built. Let's
consider a `Keyboard` resource that tracks inputs.

```ts
import { struct } from 'thyseus';

@struct
class Keyboard {
	@struct.bool declare W: boolean;
	@struct.bool declare A: boolean;
	@struct.bool declare S: boolean;
	@struct.bool declare D: boolean;
}
```

Hypothetically, there's no reason the state of the keyboard shouldn't be read
from any thread. However, we need to set up event listeners to capture
`'keydown'` and `'keyup'` events, which _does_ need to happen only on the main
thread. Constructors are called on both threads, so that's not an option,
either - this is the perfect use for an `initialize` method!

```ts
import { struct, type World } from 'thyseus';

@struct
class Keyboard {
	@struct.bool declare W: boolean;
	@struct.bool declare A: boolean;
	@struct.bool declare S: boolean;
	@struct.bool declare D: boolean;

	// This will be called once, on the main thread, while the world is being built.
	initialize(world: World) {
		// You can safely access APIs only available in the main thread here.
		const handler = (e: KeyboardEvent) => {
			const isHeld = e.type === 'keydown';
			if (e.code === 'KeyA') {
				this.A = isHeld;
			}
			if (e.code === 'KeyD') {
				this.D = isHeld;
			}
		};
		window.addEventListener('keydown', handler);
		window.addEventListener('keyup', handler);
	}
}
```

As you can see above, you can put any setup code you need in this method. If
your resource has an `initialize` method, it'll be called once with the world
initializing when that world is being built. If your setup is async, the
`initialize` method is also allowed to return a promise, which will be `await`ed
before continuing to build the world.

Resources are not required to have an `initialize` method, **but it will be
called if it exists** - you cannot use this method name for something else!
