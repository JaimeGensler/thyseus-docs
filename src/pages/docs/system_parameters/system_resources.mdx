# System Resources

System Resources are a variation of resources that are unique _per system_,
rather than per world. This means that multiple system resources of the same
type can exist in the world. A system can also have multiple of the same type of
system resource, each containing different values:

```ts
class A {
	value: number = 0;
}

function mySystem(a1: Res<A>, a2: Res<A>) {
	console.log(a1 === a2); // -> true
}
function mySystem(a1: SystemRes<A>, a2: SystemRes<A>) {
	console.log(a1 === a2); // -> false
}
```

System resources are scoped to the system that uses them; if a system exists in
multiple schedules, it will _always_ receive the same system resource! If your
system needs to receive different objects in different schedules, you can
_clone_ that system and use the clone in one of the schedules.

Apart from their scope, system resources function identically to normal
resources. In fact, the same class could be used both as a system resource and
as a world resource!
